"""UI v81 (migration 20270714_365): the Home page read gets back the four earlier fixes that
migration 20270710_361 dropped, and keeps the "Paid on time" and "Birthdays" cards.

Migration 361 replaced `app.home_page` with a text written from migration 222, so the changes of
migrations 238 (a Unit with no Meter), 242 (a draft the read does not understand), 243 (speed)
and 258 (a Unit not for rent) were lost. Migration 365 puts them back from the text the database
holds. Their own tests (`test_final_settlement_preview_migration`, `test_v1_060_release_migration`
and `test_unit_for_rent_migration`) check what each one does; these tests check the step itself.

"""The repair cost of a Problem report (migration 20270510_290, DL-125).

Staff type the cost in dollars or riel after the repair is done. A Manager checks it with the
receipt; the check makes one Expense report (already spent) per currency on 6050 Repairs and
maintenance for the Unit, which then follows the normal Expense approval.

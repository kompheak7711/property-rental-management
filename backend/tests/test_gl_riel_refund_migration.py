"""A Refund paid straight from a riel account (migration 20270610_321, DL-161).

Owner 05/11/2026 07:25: "Refund straight from riel account." The Refund stays in dollars for
the tenant; the riel that left the riel account is typed once in Ledger > Needs check, and the
Refund then posts out of the riel account with its riel.

The Payment and the Refund are made through the V1 services; the ledger part runs inside one
transaction and rolls back.

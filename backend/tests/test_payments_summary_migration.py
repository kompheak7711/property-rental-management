"""Real PostgreSQL coverage of the Payments page period read (V1-058 R5c-3a).

Each payment in the period is split by what it paid (Rent, Utilities, Services, late-payment
charges, Deposits, Short stay, Products, Damage, Other charges, Customer Credit) and what is
left; the cards add up to what was received. Migration 20270713_364 (UI v81, owner 12/11/2026)
divided the old "move-out charges" kind by the type of the Invoice (DL-221).

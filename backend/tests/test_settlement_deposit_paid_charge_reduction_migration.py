"""A charge reduction of the unpaid rest of a partly Deposit-paid obligation (V1-056 sub-slice
10c-3c-2).

Owner answer (a) to Q-2026-10-10-70: after the Lease's Final Settlement is closed, a
`CHARGE_REDUCTION` correction (the 10c-3a Late-payment Charge form and the 10c-1a Invoice-line
form) accepts an obligation that a Deposit application partly paid, within its unpaid rest (the
current obligation less every active application, Deposit applications not reversed included).
The Deposit application stays; nothing is released and no money moves; a reduction above the
unpaid rest stays refused, and an obligation the Deposit application paid with no unpaid rest left
keeps the Deposit refusal (owner answer (a) to Q-2026-10-11-80) (BR-SETTLE-013, BR-SETTLE-012,
BR-LATE-005, BR-AUTH-010, DL-032).
Owner answer 3 of 2026-10-16 to the 10c-3c-1 report: both writers reach the 8a-1 refusal here,
because an active Deposit application pays the obligation when the confirm writes its linked row,
and the row meets the hardened rule of sub-slice 10c-3c-1 (its reference or correlation names the
correction, whose draft names exactly that obligation).

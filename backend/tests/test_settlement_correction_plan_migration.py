"""The shared DL-032 step of a post-settlement correction (V1-056 sub-slice 10c-2a-2).

Value a correction releases, or a Deposit holds again after closure, is used under the Settlement
rules before anything is refunded (owner answer 1 to Q-2026-10-07-41): each Customer's own Credit
pays that Customer's open debt on the Lease first (answer 1 to Q-2026-10-07-42), released Credit
pays its own Customer's debt before any Refund (answer 2), then the Deposits pay the Lease's open
debt in the DL-032 order and only the rest is refunded, with one Refund method, note, recipient and
agreement (answer 3 to Q-41). No correction variant uses the step yet, so these tests build the
correction by hand through the internal sub-slice 10a functions, in one owner transaction, as no
role can: the release (Deposit application reversals and a linked credit Adjustment) and then the
step.

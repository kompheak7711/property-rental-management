"""Login sub-slice L3b: wrong sign-in tries counted in the database, and the waits they start.

DL-080 item 10 as amended by the owner (DL-081), Q-2026-10-21-154 (a), SEC-012, UI-109,
API-096, DB-AUTH-011 (migration `20270128_185`). One throwaway database at head; accounts and
real Argon2id credentials are written as the table owner; earlier tries and waits are written as
the table owner with times taken back from the database clock, and every sign-in runs as the
runtime role through `PostgresAuthenticationFlow`. Each test uses its own accounts and request
sources, so the order of the tests does not matter.

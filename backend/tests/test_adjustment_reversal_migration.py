"""The mistaken credit Adjustment reversal before closure (V1-056 sub-slice 10f-1).

Owner answer 7 to Q-2026-10-06-36 and the slice 10 entry of the plan (owner answer to the 8f
report): an invoices.adjust holder records an ADJUSTMENT_REVERSAL draft, and only a
financial.approve holder confirms it. The confirm writes the Adjustment reversal (DB-INV-010) and
puts the released value back on the line: the part of each released value's Credit still available
is applied to the line again (BR-CREDIT-008), and any part already used elsewhere stays as debt on
the line. An Adjustment that a resolution wrote is refused (owner answer (a) to Q-2026-10-16-118
point 2); since sub-slice 10f-1b every put-back goes back on the Adjustment's own line with the
label put back by a correction, also where the Rent-first order (BR-CREDIT-006) would choose
another line (point 1 (a)).
After the Lease's Final Settlement is closed the reversal is a correction (sub-slice 10f-2).

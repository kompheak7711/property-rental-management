"""Post-settlement correction: Refund of a Deposit-paid charge (V1-056 sub-slice 10c-2a-3).

The REFUND correction of sub-slice 10c-1b also corrects a line a Deposit application paid when the
Final Settlement closed. The release takes whole sources newest first across Deposit applications,
Payment allocations and Credit applications (owner answer 2 to Q-2026-10-07-41); a released Deposit
application is reversed and its value goes back to its Deposit, never to Customer Credit. Every
REFUND correction then runs the shared DL-032 step of sub-slice 10c-2a-2: released Credit first
pays its own Customer's open debt on the Lease (answer 2 to Q-2026-10-07-42), released Deposit value
pays the Lease's open debt in the DL-032 order, and only the rest is refunded. The 8a-1 refusal lets
the correction's own Adjustment through (answer to Q-2026-10-07-46); a remaining Pet Deposit step at
a BR-DEP-027 termination needs a new Customer choice (answer 3 to Q-2026-10-07-44); the confirm
locks the Lease row in the 8e-3 order (answer 4 to Q-2026-10-07-44). Every Settlement here closes
through the real confirm (owner answer to Q-2026-10-07-47).

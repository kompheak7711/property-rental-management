"""Pay back returned Pet Refund-review money after a pet noncompliance termination (V1-056
sub-slice 10c-2b-5).

Owner answer pay back to Q-2026-10-09-61, answer (a) to Q-2026-10-10-73, answers (A) and (b) to
Q-2026-10-10-75 and answer (a) to Q-2026-10-10-76: money of a Pet Refund-review Refund (DL-053)
that comes back is the Customer's, whenever it came back; its amount is a running count (a return
adds, a return reversal and every later Pet Refund-review Refund take out first), never more than
the Pet Deposit holds. A Pet Deposit whose held money is all pay-back money follows DL-032 before
and after closure (BR-SETTLE-008); a forfeiture (BR-DEP-022) takes only the money beyond it.

"""V1-057 step 1: the report and export rights and the Home page read (DL-072, DL-079).

The three new rights reach the default Owner and Manager bundles through a new bundle version
and never the Staff bundle; the Home page read gives each section only when the application
passes it, checks the active person and the allowed Property, and lists the dated to-do items.
Rows on the shared test database are rolled back or belong to this module's own Units; the
bundle migration test uses a throwaway database.

"""Post-settlement correction: pet classification of a Damage line (V1-056 sub-slice 10c-2a-5).

Owner answer to Q-2026-10-07-45 (option (a)): a Damage line whose pet classification is wrong
after closure is fixed by a new correction kind, in both directions. Staff record it under
final_settlements.prepare with a reason and an evidence reference; only a financial.approve
holder confirms it (BR-AUTH-010). The charge amount stays the same and the closed inspection
record is not changed: the confirmation writes a classification record linked to the correction
(DB-SETTLE-007, DB-SETTLE-005), which app.invoice_line_is_pet_damage reads before the inspection,
reverses the line's Deposit applications where the corrected classification changes which
Deposit should pay, and runs the shared DL-032 step after closure (DL-032, BR-SETTLE-008,
BR-SETTLE-013) with a new Customer choice at a BR-DEP-027 termination (owner answer 3 to
Q-2026-10-07-44). The closed Settlement is never changed (BR-SETTLE-012).

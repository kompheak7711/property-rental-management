"""UI v81 round 9 (owner 12/11/2026, migration 20270713_364): the Payments list and the Receipt
page name the same things.

Money paid to a one-time charge counts under the type of its Invoice (DL-221): a short stay under
Short stay, its damage under Damage and a miscellaneous charge under Other charges. The one kind
"move-out charges" is gone. The Receipt read gives each Invoice line its parts by Invoice line.

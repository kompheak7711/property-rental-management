"""The mistaken credit Adjustment reversal after closure (V1-056 sub-slice 10f-2).

Owner answer 7 to Q-2026-10-06-36: after the Lease's Final Settlement is closed, a mistaken credit
Adjustment is reversed only inside a correction of that Settlement (the ADJUSTMENT_REVERSAL
variant of the SETTLEMENT_CORRECTION draft), prepared under final_settlements.prepare and confirmed
by financial.approve. The confirm writes the Adjustment reversal and the put-backs of sub-slice
10f-1b (the label put back by a correction, on the Adjustment's own line; owner answer (a) to
Q-2026-10-16-118), each linked to the correction (BR-SETTLE-013, DB-SETTLE-005); the rest of each
release stays as debt on the Invoice Customer's ledger (BR-SETTLE-016); the closed Settlement is
never changed (BR-SETTLE-012). Owner answer (b) to Q-2026-10-16-119: a CHARGE_REDUCTION
correction's Adjustment may be reversed and owes exactly what the reduction removed; every other
correction's Adjustment stays refused.

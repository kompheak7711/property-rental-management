"""The default Owner, Manager and Staff role bundles (login slice sub-slice L1c).

DL-074 answer 1, DL-080 item 2, DL-081 (owner answers (a) to Q-2026-10-21-150 and
Q-2026-10-21-164, G7, (a) to Q-2026-10-21-161 and (b) to Q-2026-10-21-162), SEC-021, SEC-022,
API-080, DB-AUTH-009: a Property gets its three default bundles once; the Owner and Manager
bundles hold every bundle capability of the catalog, the Staff bundle the approved daily work
only; the Owner-class account gets the Owner bundle; seeding again changes nothing; the bundles
stay editable data. Rows written on the shared test database are rolled back; the migration,
Property setup and race tests use throwaway databases.

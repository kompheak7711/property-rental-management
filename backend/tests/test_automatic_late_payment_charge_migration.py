"""Real PostgreSQL coverage of the automatic late-payment charge (V1-056 slice 11g-1; DL-076
answers 1 to 3, DL-075 answer 1, owner card of 2026-10-25 "No charge").

At 00:00 Property time on the day after an Invoice's Due Date the billing worker's pass adds one
charge of 10 percent of the amount unpaid at that moment, rounded half-up to the cent. An Invoice
already late on the pass's first day gets none; a missed day is caught up with the balance of its
own midnight. Recurring Rent is due on the 5th, so every charge day here is a 6th.

An Invoice is issued now by the shared helper; a test that needs it issued before its charge
moment backdates the issue (and any earlier Adjustment) as the table owner with the table's own
triggers off for that one statement, as other tests backdate rows they cannot reach otherwise.

V1 holds one Property, so every test shares it and its pass history: each test starts and ends
with no pass recorded (the owner removes the rows, triggers off), uses its own Rent month, and
records its own Invoices directly after setting the last finished pass, so other tests' Invoices
never change its result. The database refuses a pass instant older than an hour, so the paging
and counting of a whole pass are covered by ``test_late_payment_job.py``.

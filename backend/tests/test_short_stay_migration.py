"""Daily and weekly rent on the real database (migration 20270531_310, phase 6 step 1).

One Unit never has two bookings, or a booking and a signed Lease, on the same night; the booking
wins over a new Lease. The total of a booking is the sum of its price lines. Quotes, price lines,
history and guest notes never change; deposits, housekeeping tasks and damage charges move
forward once. A card number is never saved. Only a check-in makes a Unit Short stay.

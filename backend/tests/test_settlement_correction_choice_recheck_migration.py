"""Post-settlement correction: the Customer choice checked again in the shared step (V1-056
sub-slice 10c-2a-6).

Owner answer 3 to Q-2026-10-07-44 and BR-DEP-027: a correction that uses the remaining Pet Deposit
by the Customer's choice needs a choice given for that correction; neither the Final Settlement's
choice nor an earlier correction's is reused. The recorders check it when a draft is recorded. Owner
answer 1 to Q-2026-10-08-52 (approved tightening) and the answer to Q-2026-10-08-54: every
correction confirm that uses a Customer choice checks it again, in the shared DL-032 step after
closure, so two drafts recorded while both were pending cannot both use one choice, whatever their
variants (BR-SETTLE-013, BR-AUTH-010).

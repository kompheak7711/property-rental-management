"""V1-060 migrations: the faster reads of `20270320_239` give the same answers, the
Billing Run writers of `20270321_240` lock the run row before the attempt row, and the excess
check of `20270322_241` waits only for PostgreSQL's own cleanup, and the Home page of
`20270323_242` reads a Refund draft it does not understand as no amount, and the reports and
Home page of `20270324_243` give the same answers as before, faster.

Runs last in `scripts/database-test.sh`, on the shared test database after every other module
has left its Invoices, adjustments, Payments, credit and deposit applications and their
reversals behind, so each kind of money record is a case.

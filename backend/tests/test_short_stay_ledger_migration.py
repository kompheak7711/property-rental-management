"""Daily and weekly rent: short-stay money in the General Ledger (migration 319).

A stay's Invoice is rent (4010) on the booking's Unit, a damage Invoice is damage recovered
(4070), a cash deposit goes through the USD cash account and 2100, and a card hold kept for
damage comes to the bank. The books check keeps 2100 equal to the deposits held.

"""ABA QR on every Invoice (owner 11 Nov 2026, cards "Approve the plan and the 5 money answers
for the ABA QR?" = "Yes, all recommended"; DL-180).

Each Invoice the Tenant bot sends goes as the A4 PDF of the approved Invoice sample, with an ABA
PayWay QR that already holds the amount to pay. These tables keep every QR asked from ABA and
what happened to it. Nothing is ever changed: a new state is a new event row.

1. ``app.aba_qr_requests``: one row per QR: the Invoice, our transaction id (unique, at most 20
   letters, the Invoice number and a count), the amount in cents (USD), the QR text and when it
   stops working (5 days after the Due Date, owner answer 3).
2. ``app.aba_qr_events``: CLOSED (a new QR replaced it, answer 1), PAID (ABA says paid),
   PAYMENT_RECORDED (the Payment is saved), NEEDS_CHECK (paid, but not as the QR asked: staff
   look, answer 4), EXPIRED, CHECK_FAILED (a check with ABA failed; tried again later).
3. ``app.aba_invoice_for_outbox`` gives the send job what the PDF needs for an Invoice message:
   the Invoice resource, the Customer's name and phone, the Unit, what is still to pay and the
   open QR of that amount if there is one.
4. ``app.aba_record_qr`` and ``app.aba_record_qr_event`` save a QR and its events;
   ``app.aba_qr_to_check`` lists the QRs to ask ABA about; ``app.aba_payment_method`` finds the
   Payment Method a QR payment is recorded with (operations file ``aba_payway``).

All functions need ``telegram.operate`` (the account the office jobs run as). Technical choices by
Claude under the owner's 2026-10-23 22:30 rule.

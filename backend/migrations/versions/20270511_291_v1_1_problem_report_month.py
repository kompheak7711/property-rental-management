"""Problem reports: the Home card and the Monthly report (DL-126).

Mock-up round 29 (Monthly report of Tenant requests) and round 32 (A7 cost in the Monthly
report, A10 Home card, "Home lists each cost still to check"), approved by the owner on
03/11/2026 with the Problem report design.

1. ``app.problem_report_summary`` (``problem_reports.read``): open reports, how many are urgent
   and late (the same Late rule as the list), and each cost still waiting for a Manager's check.
2. ``app.problem_report_month`` (``problem_reports.plan``, the Monthly report): for one month in
   the Property's time zone, the reports received (joined reports are counted apart, not
   again), urgent ones contacted on time, normal ones planned on time, done and the average days
   to fix, still open, opened again (Not fixed), who pays and the Damage charges, reports by
   type and by place, repeat problems, the reports late now, and the repair cost by Unit and by
   type (parts and outside workers, dollars and riel kept apart; the latest entry of each report
   done in the month).

Read only. Technical choices by Claude under the owner's 2026-10-23 22:30 rule.

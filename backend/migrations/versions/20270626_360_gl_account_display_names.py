"""UI v81 (B5, owner 07/11/2026): standard English names for four Ledger accounts.

The wording review the owner accepted on 07/11/2026 (docs/ui-audit/03_WORDING_REVIEW.md, owner
decision 6) renames only the English display names:

- 1100 "Customer debt · Invoices" -> "Accounts receivable · Invoices"
- 1110 "Customer debt · late-payment charges" -> "Accounts receivable · late-payment charges"
- 2210 "Money not used yet" -> "Unapplied payments"
- 3900 "Profit kept from past years" -> "Retained earnings"

Display only. Codes, types, control sources, Khmer names and every entry stay as they are. The
names live in two places: ``app.gl_chart_template`` (copied when a Property's ledger starts; its
update trigger is paused for this one change) and ``app.gl_accounts`` (each Property's chart,
where the guard allows a name change). A name the Property has already changed itself is kept.

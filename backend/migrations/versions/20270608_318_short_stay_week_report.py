# ruff: noqa: E501
"""Daily and weekly rent, phase 6 step 5c: the weekly report and tenant complaints.

The PRD "How we judge the test" (owner 03/11/2026): occupancy (the share of unit-nights that are
paid), income per unit each week after cleaning, laundry and booking-site costs, the guests who
signed a monthly Lease, and damage and complaints from monthly tenants, compared with the 40%
occupancy before the test. The booking-site fees and the cleaning costs are used only by this
report; the owner sets the real values in Settings (PRD "Price details").

Readings by Claude (owner rule 2026-10-23 22:30, non-money): a week is 7 days from the day asked
for (the screen asks for Mondays); the Units in the report are the Units for rent that are empty,
in a short stay or being cleaned now, plus any Unit with a short-stay night that week; a night is
counted when the stay is paid, paid on the site, checked in or checked out; a stay's money is
shared evenly by its nights; money kept after a late cancel counts in the week of the cancel.
Cleaning is the change-over cost plus linen for each check-out (its room check, not skipped), and
linen for each daily clean done. Also: a quote shows the 1-month-only price and the monthly rent next to
the stay (PRD "night, week and month prices side by side").

Forward-only and additive.

"""General Ledger records: expenses, bills, money moves, assets, adjustments, close (PR-GL).

Revision ID: 20270406_256
Revises: 20270405_255
Create Date: 2026-11-02

Owner approved the ledger database plan on 2026-11-02 21:08
(https://claude.ai/artifact/5nttjeU5y5SaNSHU1etyuK, section 3.4). Every table is new; no
existing table changes. Each record keeps who and when; money is whole cents in ``bigint``.

- ``gl_expense_requests`` + ``gl_expense_request_events`` (ER): a request before spending,
  or an urgent report after it. Nobody decides their own request, except the Owner's own
  spending kept with a note (D4). A Unit only on an account that allows one. Never edited;
  each step is an event; void with a reason.
- ``gl_expenses`` (EX): posted with its entry; void = a reversal entry.
- ``gl_supplier_bills`` + ``gl_bill_payments`` + ``gl_bill_payment_reversals`` (SB): payments
  never more than the bill.
- ``gl_money_moves`` (MV): between two different cash or bank accounts.
- ``gl_owner_money``, ``gl_petty_cash_topups``.
- ``gl_write_offs``: marks a confirmed V1 CHARGE_REDUCTION correction as a write-off (Q5);
  the posting job posts it to 6160.
- ``gl_fixed_assets`` (FA): depreciation starts the month after purchase (decision 25).
- ``gl_adjusting_entries`` + lines (AJ): no control or tax account; the approver is never the
  preparer (D5).
- ``gl_opening_balances`` + lines: one batch per Property; no control account.
- ``gl_budgets`` + lines: an approved budget is locked; a change is a new version (D3).
- ``gl_bank_reconciliations`` + items, ``gl_cash_counts``, ``gl_fx_revaluations``,
  ``gl_close_runs`` (append-only, every close try with each check result).

Status changes follow fixed steps (``app.gl_guard_record``); other fields change only with
a step. Limits (Expense limit, petty cash amount, asset limit, budget warning) stay in the
business rules and are checked by the coding phase, never here.

Downgrade removes only these objects and refuses once any ledger record or entry exists.

"""Short stays: notices for guests by the Tenant bot (DL-238).

Owner (14 Nov 2026): "Let's start building notice for short stay", with the four notices Claude
proposed on the same day:

1. Check-out reminder: by itself at 18:00 the evening before check-out. It names the check-out
   time and the late check-out of the Business rules (until 18:00, $5, free for a stay of 7 nights
   or more), or the later time when late check-out is already added to the stay.
2. Late check-out notice: by itself 30 minutes after the check-out time (or after the late
   check-out time when it is added) while the guest is still checked in. No money is added; the
   front desk decides.
3. House-rule warning: staff (``short_stays.desk``) write it with the reason. Warning 1, then the
   final warning 2. After the final warning a Manager may end the stay early, with the rule for
   early check-out (unused nights stay paid). Nothing here ends a stay or adds a charge.
4. Unpaid charge notice: by itself from 09:00 the day after staff add a charge to the stay (a fee,
   an extension or a damage charge) that is still not fully paid.

Each notice is sent to the Telegram links of the booking (the check-in QR, DL-214), in the language
each guest chose. A guest with no link gets no message: the Notices page lists the notice under
"Tell the guest in person" until staff mark it told. Paper is not used for short stays.

What changes:

- ``app.short_stay_guest_notices``: each notice once (one reminder and one late notice per
  check-out day, two warnings per stay, one notice per charge), with the message fields as they
  were that day. ``app.short_stay_guest_notice_deliveries`` keeps the Telegram messages, and
  ``app.short_stay_guest_notice_told`` the notices staff gave in person. Never changed.
- ``app.short_stay_notices_run`` (``telegram.operate``, run by the Telegram pull job) records the
  automatic notices that are due and sends what was not sent yet.
- ``app.give_short_stay_warning`` and ``app.short_stay_notice_told`` (``short_stays.desk``), and
  ``app.short_stay_notices_page`` (``short_stays.read``) for the Notices page.

Times are Asia/Phnom_Penh (the Property's time zone). Technical choices by Claude under the
owner's 2026-10-23 22:30 rule; the four notices and their times are the owner's.

Forward-only.

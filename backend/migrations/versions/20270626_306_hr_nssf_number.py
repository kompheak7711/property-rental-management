"""HRIS: an optional NSSF number with the ID details (owner 2026-11-07).

Owner 07/11 17:59 picked one extra employee field: the NSSF number, optional. It is kept with
the ID details (app.employee_identity_records), so only people with See salaries see it, and a
change adds a new row like every other ID change. Add employee and Change ID details may send
it; nothing requires it.

Technical choices by Claude under the owner's 2026-10-23 22:30 rule.

"""General Ledger money records API (phase 6 step 3).

Owner decisions: the expense flow of 02/11/2026, D4 (nobody approves their own; the Owner's own
spending goes in at once with a note), the round 21 and 22 screens of DESIGN.md, and the rights
table of 03/11/2026 (06:56 plan L1; 07:03 a Manager approves up to the Expense limit).

Every change goes through one checked database function (migration `20270416_266`), which checks
the actor's right for the Property again, writes the record, its journal entry and one audit
event. The route checks the main right first so a signed-in user without it gets 403 at once.

Reads (`private, no-store`):

- `GET /api/v1/properties/{property_id}/expense-requests` (`expenses.request`): a Staff member sees
  their own; anyone who approves or records Expenses sees all. An Expense report sent more than
  `EXP_REPORT_DAYS` after the spending is marked late.
- `GET .../ledger/suppliers` (`expenses.request`), `GET .../ledger/expenses` and
  `GET .../ledger/supplier-bills` (`ledger.read`).

Changes (browser mutation checks): Expense requests and reports, decisions, advances, bills, pay
back staff, voids, expenses recorded straight, supplier bill payments and their reversal, money
moves, owner money, petty cash top-ups and cash counts.

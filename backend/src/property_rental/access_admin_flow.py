"""PostgreSQL account and role bundle administration flow (login slice sub-slice L2b-2).

API-079, API-080, DL-081, SEC-014, SEC-021, SEC-075, DB-AUTH-010: every change goes through the
audited, Owner-only `app.admin_*` definer functions, one READ COMMITTED transaction per call. Each
change reads its result back and checks it in the same transaction, before the commit. Database
errors become stable codes with fixed plain messages; database text is never passed on.

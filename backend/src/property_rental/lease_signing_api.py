"""What a Lease owes at signing, the draft's Security Deposit and the Initial Rent Invoice.

V1-060 B6, DL-100 (owner 27/10/2026): a walk-in draft Lease carries the Security Deposit the
customer will pay, so its printed draft shows it; Sign Lease first receives the full money due at
signing (the rest of the Security Deposit and the Initial Rent Invoice), signs, then makes the
Initial Rent Invoice at once so the money just received pays it. The amounts come from
app.lease_signing_preview (migration 20270325_244), which reads the Invoice generator's own rules;
the Invoice is made by app.generate_rent_service_invoice, as billing makes every Rent Invoice.

DL-101 (owner 27/10/2026, migration 20270326_245): the Security Deposit amount is a Lease term like
the Rent, so a draft from a Reservation records it too, starting at the Reservation's amount and
never below the money already received. Sign Lease applies it to the Reservation's Security Deposit
right after signing (app.apply_lease_planned_security_deposit), then receives the rest.

DL-108 (V1-060 B7, migration 20270330_249): Sign Lease is one command in one database transaction,
app.sign_lease_with_payment: the Payment and its Receipt, the signatures, the signing, the draft's
Security Deposit, the Initial Rent Invoice, the money paying that Invoice by name and the rest
going into the Security Deposit are all saved, or nothing is. The separate Initial Rent Invoice and
apply routes of DL-100 and DL-101 are gone; their database functions are steps of the command.

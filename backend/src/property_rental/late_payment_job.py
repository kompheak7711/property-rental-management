"""The automatic late-payment charge pass (V1-056 slice 11g-1; DL-076 answers 1 to 3).

The billing worker runs this pass while it holds its Property's worker lock. The database decides
everything (`app.automatic_late_payment_charge_window`, `_candidates` and `_record`): the day's
window, the Invoices to look at, and for each one the charge or the reason it gets none. This
module only pages through the candidates on one connection, records each Invoice in its own short
READ COMMITTED transaction (the closed Final Settlement guard needs it), and marks the day done
when every candidate was looked at with no failure; a failed Invoice is tried again on the next
pass, which then also covers the days since the last finished one.

Only outcome counts and SQLSTATE codes are written to the log: no amounts, no Customer data.

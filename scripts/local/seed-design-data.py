"""Load the design's sample data (mock-up v81, data.py) into an EMPTY test database.

UI v81 (owner 08/11/2026 09:57): a screen counts as checked only when it looks right with the
design's sample data, so the review app is filled with the same Units, people and money the
mock-up shows: Units U101 to U406 with their Unit Types and rents, the Customers' real names and
phone numbers, one signed Lease per occupied Unit with the design's dates, this month's Rent
Invoices with their payments (three still unpaid), the U406 Reservation with its Deposit and
drafted Lease, the meters and their readings, and two birthdays in the coming week.

The rows are written the way the backend's own integration tests write them (direct SQL as the
migration role). Leases, readings and payments carry the dates they would have had. An Invoice
and a payment allocation cannot be dated in the past: the database stamps the issue time and the
allocation time with the real clock and refuses an issue time before the lines were written
(app.stamp_invoice_detail_change, app.validate_invoice_issuance_lines,
app.validate_payment_allocation_source). So the Rent history of earlier months is NOT made up:
the Invoices are this month's (dated the 25th of last month, due on the 5th, issued the moment
the script runs), their payments are dated in the past week but allocated now, and "Paid on
time" counts them as paid late unless the script runs on or before the 5th. Cards such as
"Overdue" and "Paid on time" fill up as real months pass. Nothing is deleted or changed.

TEST DATABASES ONLY. The script refuses to run when the database already holds a Unit.

    cd backend && MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL=... .venv/bin/python ../scripts/local/seed-design-data.py

Options: --username <owner account> (default "owner"), --today YYYY-MM-DD (default: the
Property's business date). On the Mac test app: sh scripts/local/seed-design-data.sh.

# 001 - Domain Model

**Project:** Property Rental Management System
**Document:** Domain Model
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Owner Review
**Audience:** Product Owner, Business Analysts, Software Architects, Developers, QA Engineers

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the business domain of the Property Rental Management System.

Its purpose is to establish a common business language and accurately model the real-world operation of a residential rental property before any database schema, APIs, user interfaces, or implementation details are designed.

This document intentionally focuses on **what the business is** rather than **how the software is implemented**.

Implementation details such as SQL tables, REST APIs, user interfaces, permission matrices, and deployment architecture are documented separately.

---

# 2. Scope

The system manages the complete lifecycle of residential rental operations for **one property**.

The domain includes:

- Unit management
- Customer management
- Reservation management
- Lease management
- Occupancy management
- Utility meter management
- Utility readings
- Invoice generation
- Payment processing
- Deposit management
- Move-in
- Move-out
- Final settlement
- Historical auditing

The system does not include:

- Accounting or General Ledger
- Payroll
- Human Resources
- Property construction management
- Building maintenance work orders
- Multi-property portfolio management
- Owner accounting
- Government tax reporting

These domains may be integrated in the future but are outside the scope of this system.

Amended by DL-115 (owner, 2026-10-29): V1.1 adds new-customer requests, Repair Requests with Repair Quotations (a simple list of reported problems, not building maintenance work orders), the move-in Joint Inspection and the Unit Check, staff reports from Telegram, photos, Customer birthdays, the Unit care history, "Paid on time", Unit features and the Services Invoice kind. Still outside: a CRM for current tenants, the General Ledger, recording repair costs that CHETANA pays, planned maintenance, supplier lists and procurement.

---

# 3. Domain Vision

The Property Rental Management System is designed around one fundamental principle:

> Every significant business event occurring during the lifecycle of a rental unit must be accurately represented, historically preserved, and fully auditable.

The system is intended to become the single source of truth for all operational, financial, and occupancy information related to a single rental property.

The domain model prioritizes:

- Business correctness
- Historical accuracy
- Financial integrity
- Traceability
- Auditability
- Long-term maintainability

---

# 4. Core Business Principles

The following principles govern every part of the domain model.

## 4.1 One Property per Application

Each deployed application manages exactly one property.

The Property entity represents the entire apartment building managed by the application.

Supporting multiple properties within the same application is intentionally outside the current business scope.

---

## 4.2 Business First

The domain model reflects the actual business rather than software implementation.

Business concepts take precedence over database optimization or programming convenience.

---

## 4.3 Historical Data is Never Lost

Business history is permanently preserved.

Instead of deleting records, the system records business transitions over time.

Examples include:

- Previous tenants
- Previous leases
- Historical utility rates
- Historical meter replacements
- Previous invoices
- Previous payments
- Historical deposits
- Historical reservations

Historical information must remain available for reporting and auditing.

---

## 4.4 Financial Integrity

Every financial transaction must be traceable.

Money cannot appear, disappear, or be silently modified.

Every financial adjustment must have a corresponding business event and audit record.

---

## 4.5 One Source of Truth

Every business concept has one authoritative owner.

Examples:

- Unit availability is determined by Reservations and Leases.
- Occupancy is determined by Occupancy records.
- Financial balances are determined from Invoices, Late-payment Charges, Payments,
  applications, Credits, Deposits, Refunds, Adjustments, reversals, and Final Settlements.
- Utility consumption is determined from Utility Readings.

Derived or materialized views must remain reconcilable to authoritative records and
must never become independently editable competing sources of truth.

---

# 5. Ubiquitous Language

The following terminology shall be used consistently throughout the project.

## Property

The apartment building managed by this application.

Its authoritative business timezone is `Asia/Phnom_Penh` for Due Dates, overdue
boundaries, schedules, and other calendar-day business rules.

Each application contains exactly one Property.

---

## Unit

A rentable residential space within the Property.

Each Unit belongs to exactly one Property.

A Unit has:

- Unit Number
- Floor
- Unit Type
- Current Status

Unit Types:

- Studio
- One Bedroom
- Two Bedroom
- Three Bedroom

---

## Customer

A person recorded by the business.

A Customer may participate in multiple business processes over time.

Examples include:

- Reservation customer
- Primary tenant
- Lease signer
- Occupant
- Former tenant
- Payment payer

The system does not classify Customers into permanent customer types.

Customer roles are determined by their relationships with business entities rather than by a fixed customer category.

Each Customer has a unified Customer Account Ledger view of that Customer's
chronological financial history and current financial position. The Ledger is a
reconstructable projection of authoritative financial events, not a replacement
financial record or a full accounting General Ledger.

---

## Customer Account Ledger

The unified business-facing financial view for one Customer. It shows charges,
Payments, Customer Credit, Refunds, Adjustments, Deposits, Late-payment Charges,
applications, reversals, outstanding obligations, and current balances while
preserving each underlying record's identity.

The Ledger may be derived from authoritative immutable financial events. Whether
later technical specifications persist materialized ledger entries is an
implementation choice; no Ledger entry may become a conflicting source of truth.

---

## Reservation

A Reservation temporarily holds a Unit for one Customer until its Lease is signed. It may
coexist with a DRAFTED Lease for the same planned tenancy while the Reservation remains
ACTIVE; it becomes COMPLETED when that Lease becomes SIGNED (BR-RES-013, DL-064). A
Reservation is optional (BR-RES-001, DL-066).

A Reservation:

- reserves one Unit
- belongs to one Customer
- requires a Security Deposit
- has an expiration date
- may be cancelled
- may proceed to move-in

Reservation statuses:

- ACTIVE
- CANCELLED
- COMPLETED

---

## Security Deposit

A mandatory financial liability held by the Property.

The Security Deposit may be paid in multiple installments.

Typically, a Customer pays only part of the required Security Deposit during Reservation and pays the remaining balance within five calendar days after the Lease Start Date; an unpaid balance never blocks move-in (BR-DEP-006, DL-066).

The Security Deposit:

- is not rental income
- is not refundable during an active Lease
- is applied only during final settlement
- may be partially or fully refunded after settlement
- must remain fully auditable

---

## Pet Deposit

An additional Deposit liability that applies only when both:

- the pet is approved; and
- the applicable signed Lease terms require a Pet Deposit.

Pet Deposit remains a separately traceable liability. Unlike Security Deposit, it
may be refunded during an active Lease after the pet permanently leaves and all
applicable pet-related obligations are resolved. Any later application to Invoice
obligations occurs only under the approved Final Settlement rules.

---

## Lease

A legally binding rental agreement between the Property and a Customer.

A Lease:

- applies to one Unit
- has exactly one Primary Tenant
- may have multiple Lease Signers
- may have multiple Occupants
- requires a Security Deposit
- may require a Pet Deposit

Lease statuses:

- DRAFTED
- SIGNED
- CANCELLED
- TERMINATED

---

## Primary Tenant

The principal Customer responsible for managing the Lease.

Every Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant.

A Customer may become the Primary Tenant on multiple Leases over time.

---

## Lease Signer

A Customer who signs the Lease agreement.

All Lease Signers share joint responsibility for the entire Lease balance.

The system does not divide responsibility by percentage.

A Lease Signer is not required to live in the Unit.

---

## Occupant

A Customer who physically lives in the Unit.

Occupancy records represent who resides in the Unit and when.

Occupancy does not determine financial responsibility.

---

## Utility Meter

A physical electricity or water meter assigned to a Unit.

A Unit may have multiple historical Utility Meters due to replacement.

Only one active meter may exist for each utility type.

---

## Utility Reading

A recorded reading taken from a Utility Meter.

Utility Readings determine customer utility usage and utility billing.

Historical Utility Readings must never be silently overwritten, deleted, or
reassigned. Authorized corrections are permitted with complete audit history.

---

## Invoice

A financial document requesting payment.

Invoice categories include:

- Rent
- Utilities
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges

Invoices represent receivables owed to the Property.

---

## Late-payment Charge Decision

The one final management decision for an applicable overdue Invoice. It records the
remaining unpaid overdue Invoice balance at assessment, the 10% default calculation,
and management's confirmed, reduced, or waived result.

The decision is not an Invoice status and does not rewrite the original Invoice
principal. A positive approved amount is an explicit linked financial charge; a
waiver remains a permanent audited decision without creating a charge.

Replaced by DL-076 (owner, 2026-10-20): there is no management decision any more; the app adds the charge by itself the day after the Due Date. A reduction or waiver after a Customer complaint is recorded on its own.

---

## Late-payment Charge

A separate explicit financial obligation created only when authorized management
confirms a positive amount through the final Late-payment Charge Decision for one
source overdue Invoice.

A Late-payment Charge belongs to exactly one Customer and exactly one source Invoice.
It becomes payable immediately at its confirmation timestamp, contributes to the
Customer's overall outstanding balance, and may be satisfied by authorized Payment
Allocation or Customer Credit application without issuing another Invoice.

It is not an Invoice, Invoice Category, Miscellaneous Charge, source-Invoice line, or
modification of source-Invoice principal. Its original amount and decision remain
historical facts while its remaining balance is derived from valid applications and
reversals. It never generates another late-payment charge.

---

## Nonpayment Warning Notice

A formal auditable Notice issued when an applicable Rent obligation remains unpaid
at 20 calendar days after its Due Date. The Notice warns that continued nonpayment
through 30 days overdue may lead authorized management to initiate the approved
Lease termination or surrender process.

Replaced by DL-064 (noted 2026-10-21, docs-only rules update 2b, part 9): the Rent nonpayment days are counted from the 1st of the billed month, not from the Due Date: day 20 is the 20th and day 30 is the 1st plus 29 days (BR-LEASE-026).

---

## Serious Nonpayment Default

A permanent historical condition recorded when an applicable Rent obligation remains
unpaid at 30 calendar days after its Due Date. It may permit authorized management to
initiate the approved termination or surrender process, but it does not itself
terminate the Lease, end Occupancy, change Unit status, create Move-out, or create
Final Settlement.

Replaced by DL-064 (noted 2026-10-21, docs-only rules update 2b, part 9): the Rent nonpayment days are counted from the 1st of the billed month, not from the Due Date: day 20 is the 20th and day 30 is the 1st plus 29 days (BR-LEASE-026).

---

## Payment

Money received from a Customer.

Payments may be allocated to one or more valid Customer obligations by authorized
staff. Allocation to a mixed Invoice preserves sufficient Invoice-line or obligation
category detail to determine what remains unpaid.

The system supports:

- Full payment
- Partial payment
- Advance payment
- Overpayment
- Customer credit
- Refund
- Reversal

---

## Receipt

A numbered customer-facing acknowledgment that the Property received the money
recorded by one Payment and, where applicable, how its value was allocated or applied.

Receipt does not replace Payment and does not create money. Reprinting a Receipt does
not create another Payment or another receipt-of-money event; the same Receipt identity
and reprint history remain auditable.

---

## Final Settlement

The business process performed after Lease termination.

Final Settlement determines:

- Outstanding invoices
- Damage charges
- Utility charges
- Deposit application
- Refunds
- Remaining balances

A Lease is financially complete only after Final Settlement has been finalized.

---

This domain is intentionally centered around the lifecycle of a Unit—from reservation through lease, occupancy, billing, payment, move-out, and historical archival—while ensuring every business and financial event remains permanently traceable.

---

# 7. Domain Building Blocks

The Property Rental Management System follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles by organizing the business into Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, and Domain Services.

The purpose of this section is to define the business ownership and lifecycle of each concept.

No database schema or implementation details are included in this document.

---

# 8. Aggregate Overview

The domain consists of the following Aggregate Roots.

| Aggregate        | Purpose                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Property         | Represents the apartment building managed by the application. |
| Unit             | Represents a rentable residential unit.                       |
| Customer         | Represents a person recorded by the business.                 |
| Reservation      | Holds a Unit for one Customer until its Lease is signed.      |
| Lease            | Represents the legal rental agreement.                        |
| Utility Meter    | Represents a physical utility meter installed on a Unit.      |
| Utility Reading  | Represents recorded meter readings used for billing.          |
| Invoice          | Represents charges owed by a Customer.                        |
| Payment          | Represents money received from a Customer.                    |
| Deposit          | Represents Security Deposit and Pet Deposit liabilities.      |
| Final Settlement | Represents the financial closing of a Lease.                  |

Although these aggregates interact with one another, each Aggregate is responsible for protecting its own business consistency.

---

# 9. Aggregate Definitions

## 9.1 Property Aggregate

### Purpose

The Property Aggregate represents the apartment building managed by the application.

Exactly one Property exists within each application.

The Property Aggregate owns the overall business environment but does not directly manage operational transactions.

### Responsibilities

- Store property information
- Define the property's identity
- Own the authoritative `Asia/Phnom_Penh` business timezone
- Own all Units
- Provide the root of the business hierarchy

### Owns

- Units

### Referenced By

- All operational aggregates

### Lifecycle

```text
Created
    │
    ▼
Active
```

The Property is expected to remain active for the lifetime of the application.

---

## 9.2 Unit Aggregate

### Purpose

A Unit represents a rentable residential space.

A Unit exists independently of Reservations, Leases, or Customers.

### Responsibilities

- Maintain unit identity
- Track current availability
- Record current operational status
- Associate Utility Meters
- Preserve historical leasing records

### Attributes

- Unit Number
- Floor
- Unit Type
- Status

### Unit Types

- Studio
- One Bedroom
- Two Bedroom
- Three Bedroom

### Unit Statuses

- A Unit may have many Reservations over time.
- A Unit may have many historical Leases.
- Signed Leases for the Unit must not have overlapping contractual periods.
- A Unit may have multiple historical Utility Meters.
- A Unit may have only one active Utility Meter for each Utility Type.

---

## 9.3 Customer Aggregate

### Purpose

The Customer Aggregate represents a person known by the business.

A Customer is intentionally role-neutral.

The Customer does not permanently become a Tenant, Occupant, Reservation Customer, or Lease Signer.

Instead, those roles are determined through relationships with other business entities.

### Responsibilities

- Store personal information
- Maintain customer identity
- Preserve customer history
- Provide the identity boundary for a unified reconstructable Customer Account Ledger

### Customer Roles

A Customer may become:

- Reservation Customer
- Primary Tenant
- Lease Signer
- Occupant
- Former Occupant
- Payment Payer

These are business relationships rather than customer types.

### Business Invariants

- A Customer may reserve many Units over time.
- A Customer may become Primary Tenant on many Leases.
- A Customer may sign many Leases.
- A Customer may occupy many Units over time.
- Customer records are never deleted because historical financial records depend on them.
- The Customer Account Ledger is derived from underlying authoritative financial
  events and balances and never replaces them.

---

## 9.4 Reservation Aggregate

### Purpose

A Reservation temporarily holds a Unit for one Customer before move-in.

### Responsibilities

- Reserve a Unit
- Record Reservation period
- Record Security Deposit received
- Track expiration
- Link to resulting Lease after move-in

### Reservation Status

- ACTIVE
- CANCELLED
- COMPLETED

### Business Invariants

- One Reservation belongs to one Unit.
- One Reservation belongs to one Customer.
- One Reservation results in zero or one Lease.
- A cancelled Reservation never creates a Lease.
- A COMPLETED Reservation cannot return to ACTIVE.

Reservation extension history is recorded separately and does not change the Reservation status.

---

## 9.5 Lease Aggregate

### Purpose

The Lease Aggregate represents the legal rental contract.

It controls occupancy, billing, deposits, and the tenancy lifecycle.

### Responsibilities

- Manage contractual agreement
- Assign Primary Tenant
- Record Lease Signers
- Record Occupants
- Manage deposits
- Generate recurring rent obligations
- Support termination

### Lease Status

- DRAFTED
- SIGNED
- CANCELLED
- TERMINATED

### Business Invariants

- A Lease belongs to one Unit.
- A Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant.
- A Lease may have multiple Lease Signers.
- Every Lease Signer is jointly responsible for the full Lease balance.
- A Lease may have many Occupants.
- Signed Leases for the Unit must not have overlapping contractual periods.
- A terminated Lease never becomes signed again.
- A cancelled Lease was never activated.

- A Lease End Date is the last day of a calendar month; a Lease ends mid-month only through early termination (DL-069, BR-LEASE-031).

---

## 9.6 Utility Meter Aggregate

### Purpose

Represents a physical utility meter installed on a Unit.

### Responsibilities

- Identify the physical meter
- Record installation history
- Preserve replacement history
- Associate Utility Readings

### Utility Types

- Electricity
- Water

### Business Invariants

- A Utility Meter belongs to one Unit.
- A Utility Meter measures only one Utility Type.
- A Utility Meter cannot belong to multiple Units.
- Historical Utility Meters remain permanently recorded.
- Replacing a Utility Meter never changes historical Utility Readings.

---

## 9.7 Utility Reading Aggregate

### Purpose

Represents an actual meter reading used for billing.

### Responsibilities

- Record reading value
- Record reading date
- Preserve historical consumption

### Business Invariants

- Every Utility Reading belongs to one Utility Meter.
- Utility Readings are permanent historical records.
- Historical readings cannot be reassigned to another meter, silently overwritten,
  or deleted. Authorized corrections preserve original and corrected values, actor,
  timestamp, reason, and complete audit history.
- Utility bills are calculated from Utility Readings.

---

## 9.8 Invoice Aggregate

### Purpose

Represents money owed to the Property.

### Responsibilities

- Record charges
- Maintain invoice balance
- Track obligation and Invoice-line balances
- Track Payment and Customer Credit application at sufficient obligation detail
- Preserve financial history

### Invoice Categories

- Rent
- Utilities
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges

### Business Invariants

- Every Invoice belongs to exactly one Customer.
- An Invoice may additionally be associated with zero or one Lease.
- When a Lease association exists, the Invoice Customer, Unit, obligation,
  period, and Lease context must be consistent.
- Every Rent Invoice requires the applicable signed Lease.
- An Invoice balance cannot become negative.
- Invoice-line or obligation-level remaining balances roll up exactly to the Invoice
  outstanding balance and derived status.
- Invoice history is permanent.
- Voiding an Invoice preserves its historical record.
- The Due Date is the last calendar day on which payment is timely; any remaining
  unpaid balance becomes overdue on the next calendar day in Asia/Phnom_Penh.
- An applicable Invoice has at most one final Late-payment Charge Decision.
- A late-payment charge never compounds, repeats, or generates another late-payment
  charge.

---

## 9.9 Payment Aggregate

### Purpose

Represents money received by the Property.

### Responsibilities

- Record payment received
- Allocate Payment value to specific Customer obligations and Invoice lines where
  needed
- Support issuance of the Payment's customer-facing Receipt
- Maintain customer credits
- Record refunds
- Record reversals

### Business Invariants

- One Payment may satisfy multiple valid Customer obligations.
- One Invoice may receive multiple Payments.
- One Payment may also satisfy a separate Late-payment Charge obligation.
- Payment allocation is performed manually by authorized staff.
- Payment and Receipt remain distinct records; reprinting a Receipt creates no Payment.
- Payments are never physically deleted.

---

## 9.10 Deposit Aggregate

### Purpose

Represents money held as a liability rather than income.

The Deposit Aggregate manages both Security Deposits and Pet Deposits.

### Deposit Types

- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit

### Responsibilities

- Record required deposit amount
- Record deposit payments
- Maintain outstanding balance
- Track application during Final Settlement
- Track refunds

### Business Invariants

- Deposits are liabilities.
- Security Deposit is mandatory.
- Security Deposit may be paid in installments.
- Security Deposit collected during Reservation remains the same Security Deposit after move-in.
- Pet Deposit exists only when a pet is approved and the applicable signed Lease
  terms require that Deposit.
- Deposits are applied to Invoice obligations only during Final Settlement; an
  approved active-Lease Pet Deposit Refund is separate from such application.

---

## 9.11 Final Settlement Aggregate

### Purpose

Represents the financial closing process of a terminated Lease.

### Responsibilities

- Calculate outstanding balances
- Apply deposits
- Calculate refunds
- Produce final financial result

### Business Invariants

- Every terminated Lease must complete exactly one Final Settlement.
- Final Settlement belongs to exactly one terminated Lease.
- Final Settlement occurs only after Lease termination.
- Final Settlement permanently closes the Lease financially.
- Final Settlement is fully auditable.

---

## 9.12 Late-payment Charge Aggregate

Represents a positive standalone Customer obligation confirmed by authorized
management for exactly one overdue source Invoice.

### Responsibilities

- Preserve the final management decision and source-Invoice assessment snapshot
- Maintain the original confirmed amount and remaining outstanding balance
- Accept authorized Payment Allocations and Customer Credit applications
- Preserve application, reversal, correction, and satisfaction history

### Business Invariants

- One Late-payment Charge belongs to exactly one Customer.
- One Late-payment Charge links to exactly one source Invoice.
- Its Customer must be the same Customer as the source Invoice.
- It is created only for a positive confirmed or reduced final decision.
- It becomes payable at the management confirmation timestamp without another Invoice.
- Its original amount never alters the source Invoice principal, lines, balance, or status.
- Its remaining balance cannot become negative.
- It never produces another late-payment charge.
- A waived decision creates no Late-payment Charge Aggregate.

---

# 10. Supporting Entities

Supporting Entities exist inside Aggregates and cannot exist independently.

---

## Lease Signer

Represents a Customer who signed the Lease agreement.

Responsibilities:

- Record legal responsibility
- Record signing information
- Preserve historical contract signers

Business Rules:

- One Lease may contain multiple Lease Signers.
- Every Lease Signer is jointly responsible for the entire Lease balance.
- A Lease Signer is not required to occupy the Unit.

---

## Occupancy

Represents a Customer physically living in the Unit.

Responsibilities:

- Record move-in date
- Record move-out date
- Preserve occupancy history

Business Rules:

- Occupancy does not determine financial responsibility.
- One Lease may have multiple Occupants.
- A Customer may occupy multiple Units over time.
- Occupancy history is never deleted.

---

## Payment Allocation

Represents the authorized application of Payment value to one or more Customer
obligations. For an Invoice, it preserves sufficient Invoice-line or obligation
category detail to determine remaining Rent and Service balances. It may also target a
separate Late-payment Charge. Payment-to-Deposit receipt linkage remains a distinct
Deposit event rather than an ordinary Payment Allocation.

Business Rules:

- One Payment may allocate to many valid obligations.
- One Invoice may receive many Payment Allocations.
- One Allocation may contain sufficient linked detail for multiple underlying lines
  of one selected Invoice.
- Allocation history is permanent.

---

## Receipt

Represents the numbered acknowledgment provided to a Customer for one Payment.

Responsibilities:

- Identify the source Payment and Customer
- Present money-received facts from the Payment
- Present the confirmed allocation/application breakdown when applicable
- Preserve issuer, issue time, and Receipt identity
- Preserve reprint history without creating another Payment or Receipt identity

Business Rules:

- Receipt is evidence of Payment; it is not the Payment itself.
- One Payment normally produces one business Receipt.
- A reprint preserves the original Receipt identity and source facts.
- Receipt history is permanent and auditable.

---

## Reservation Extension Notice

Represents an approved extension of a Reservation expiration date.

Responsibilities:

- Preserve original expiration date
- Record new expiration date
- Record approval history

Business Rules:

- Creating an extension does not change Reservation status.
- Multiple extensions may exist if permitted by business rules.
- Extension history is permanent.

---

# 11. Value Objects

The following concepts are immutable Value Objects within the domain.

| Value Object        | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Money               | Monetary amount with currency             |
| Date Range          | Reservation, Lease, and Occupancy periods |
| Unit Number         | Human-readable Unit identifier            |
| Meter Serial Number | Physical meter identifier                 |
| Customer Name       | Customer's legal name                     |
| Address             | Contact address                           |
| Phone Number        | Contact number                            |
| Email Address       | Contact email                             |

Value Objects have no independent identity and exist only as part of an owning Aggregate.

# 13. Domain Relationships

This section defines how the core business concepts relate to one another.

These relationships describe business ownership and cardinality only. They are not database relationships or foreign key definitions.

The domain follows the natural business lifecycle of a rental unit.

A Unit progresses through reservation, leasing, occupancy, billing, payment, move-out, and historical archival while preserving every significant business event.

# 16. Business Lifecycles

This section describes the lifecycle of major business concepts.

---

## 16.1 Unit Lifecycle

```text
VACANT
   │
   ▼
RESERVED
   │
   ▼
OCCUPIED
   │
   ├───────────────┐
   ▼               │
CLEANING           │
   │               │

UNDER_MAINTENANCE
        │
        ▼
OUT_OF_SERVICE
        │
        ▼
VACANT
```

Notes

- Reservation changes Unit status to RESERVED.
- Lease signing changes Unit status to OCCUPIED, even before physical move-in (BR-UNIT-007, DL-064).
- Move-out changes Unit to CLEANING before becoming VACANT.
- Maintenance may temporarily remove a Unit from rental.

---

## 16.2 Reservation Lifecycle

```text
Reservation Created
          │
          ▼
       ACTIVE
      /      \
     /        \
CANCELLED   COMPLETED
```

Rules

- Reservation begins in ACTIVE state.
- ACTIVE means the Reservation currently holds the Unit.
- Expiration extensions do not create a new status.
- COMPLETED means the Reservation's exactly one resulting Lease became SIGNED
  (BR-RES-013, DL-064); physical move-in is recorded separately.
- CANCELLED means the Reservation ended without successfully proceeding to tenancy
  and produces no resulting Lease.
- COMPLETED and CANCELLED are terminal and never become ACTIVE again.

---

## 16.3 Lease Lifecycle

```text
Drafted
   │
   ├────────► Cancelled
   │
   ▼
Signed
   │
   ▼
Terminated
```

Rules

- Only Drafted Leases may be Cancelled.
- Only Signed Leases may be Terminated.
- Terminated Leases are permanent historical records.

---

## 16.4 Security Deposit Lifecycle

```text
Required
    │
    ▼
Partially Paid
    │
    ▼
Fully Paid
    │
    ▼
Held During Lease
    │
    ▼
Final Settlement
    │
 ┌──┴───────────────┐
 ▼                  ▼
Applied         Refunded
```

Notes

- Partial payments are permitted.
- The same Security Deposit continues from Reservation into the Lease.
- Deposits remain liabilities throughout their lifecycle.

---

## 16.5 Utility Meter Lifecycle

```text
Installed
     │
     ▼
Active
     │
     ▼
Replaced
```

Rules

- Historical Utility Meters are never deleted.
- Meter replacement preserves all historical readings.

---

## 16.6 Utility Reading Lifecycle

```text
Reading Recorded
        │
        ▼
Billing Generated
        │
        ▼
Historical Record
```

Rules

- Readings remain permanent.
- Before Invoice issuance, an authorized corrected Reading becomes the valid billing
  input while original value, corrected value, actor, timestamp, and reason remain
  auditable.
- After Invoice issuance, a Reading may still be corrected operationally regardless
  of whether the Invoice is UNPAID, PARTIALLY_PAID, or PAID. The issued Invoice is
  never silently rewritten; any amount difference uses a linked Invoice Adjustment.

---

## 16.7 Invoice Lifecycle

```text
DRAFT
  │
  ├──────────────► VOID
  │
  ▼
UNPAID
  │
  ├──────────────► VOID
  ├──────────────► PAID
  │
  ▼
PARTIALLY_PAID
  │
  ├──────────────► UNPAID after authorized financial reversal/correction
  ├──────────────► PAID
  └──────────────► VOID only after required financial reversals

PAID
  ├──────────────► PARTIALLY_PAID after authorized financial reversal/correction
  └──────────────► UNPAID after authorized financial reversal/correction
```

Invoice status is determined by the approved issuance, allocation, Credit,
Deposit-application, reversal, and voiding rules in `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.
Invoice-status regressions are derived from valid remaining financial effects; they
are not manual status edits, partial voids, Refund semantics, or arbitrary reopening.
Voiding always preserves history.

---

## 16.8 Payment Lifecycle

```text
RECEIVED ─────────────────────────────► REVERSED
    │
    ├── unallocated          (derived allocation condition)
    ├── partially allocated  (derived allocation condition)
    └── fully allocated      (derived allocation condition)
```

Allocation progress is not a Payment record status. Unallocated excess remains
part of the RECEIVED Payment until the payer authorizes an approved Credit or
Refund disposition.

---

## 16.9 Late-payment Decision and Obligation Treatment

```text
PROPOSED CALCULATION
        │
        └── AUTHORIZED FINAL DECISION
                ├── WAIVED ──► no receivable
                ├── CONFIRMED ──► positive Late-payment Charge
                └── REDUCED ────► reduced positive Late-payment Charge

Positive Late-payment Charge
        ├── positive remaining balance
        └── zero remaining balance = fully satisfied
```

The positive obligation's state is balance-derived where possible. Authorized
correction or reversal is a linked auditable event, not silent status editing or
deletion. No Late-payment Charge generates another charge.

---

## 16.10 Final Settlement Lifecycle

```text
Lease Terminated
        │
        ▼
Settlement Created
        │
        ▼
Charges Calculated
        │
        ▼
Deposits Applied
        │
        ▼
Refund or Balance Due
        │
        ▼
Settlement Closed
```

Once closed, the Settlement becomes a permanent historical record.

---

# 17. Cross-Aggregate Invariants

The following business invariants span multiple Aggregates and must always remain true.

## Unit Availability

- A Unit cannot have more than one active Reservation.
- A Unit cannot have more than one SIGNED Lease whose contractual period covers the
  same point in time. Non-overlapping future signed coverage may coexist.

---

## Reservation Integrity

- Every Reservation belongs to exactly one Unit.
- Every Reservation belongs to exactly one Customer.

---

## Lease Integrity

- Every Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant.
- The Primary Tenant must also be a Lease Signer.
- Every signed Lease belongs to one Unit.

---

## Occupancy Integrity

- Occupancy records determine who lives in the Unit.
- Lease Signers determine contractual responsibility.
- Occupancy and contractual responsibility are intentionally separate concepts.

---

## Utility Integrity

- Historical Utility Readings always remain linked to the Utility Meter that produced them.
- Historical Utility Readings may be corrected only through an authorized,
  fully-audited correction that preserves original and corrected values.
- Replacing a Utility Meter never alters historical billing records.

---

## Financial Integrity

- Deposits are liabilities.
- Payments never disappear.
- Invoice balances cannot become negative.
- Every financial adjustment must be auditable.

---

# 18. Financial Domain

The financial domain represents monetary obligations, money received, liabilities,
credits, adjustments, and settlement activities belonging to Customers. A
financial record may additionally be associated with a Lease when its approved
business context requires that association.

The financial model is designed around the following principles:

- Every financial event must be traceable.
- Historical financial records must be preserved.
- Deposits are liabilities, not income.
- Payments and invoice allocations are separate concepts.
- Partial payment and overpayment are supported.
- Financial corrections must be performed through explicit business actions rather than silent record replacement.
- Historical rates used for billing must remain preserved.

---

# 19. Financial Responsibility

Financial responsibility is determined by Lease Signers.

Every Lease Signer is jointly responsible for the entire outstanding Lease balance.

The system does not divide responsibility between signers.

For example:

```text
Lease Balance: $800

Signer A responsibility: Full $800
Signer B responsibility: Full $800
```

This does not mean that the Property may collect the balance twice.

It means that any Lease Signer may be held responsible for satisfying the full unpaid obligation until that obligation has been settled.

Occupancy alone does not create financial responsibility.

A Customer may therefore:

- live in the Unit without being financially responsible, or
- sign the Lease and be financially responsible without living in the Unit.

---

# 20. Invoice Domain

## 20.1 Purpose

An Invoice represents an amount owed by exactly one Customer. It may additionally
be associated with zero or one Lease when applicable.

An Invoice establishes a receivable but does not itself represent money received.

Invoices may contain one or more charge components.

---

## 20.2 Invoice Categories

The domain supports the following invoice categories:

- Rent
- Utilities
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges

Deposits are not Invoice categories because deposits are liabilities rather than operating income.

---

## 20.3 Invoice Responsibility

Every Invoice belongs to exactly one Customer.

An Invoice may additionally be associated with zero or one Lease. Customer
ownership remains explicit and is not derived exclusively from a Lease.

When an Invoice is associated with a Lease, its Customer must be financially
responsible under that Lease, and its Unit, obligation, billing period, and other
contractual context must agree with the Lease.

Selecting one Invoice Customer does not remove the approved joint responsibility
of other Lease Signers. Rent remains Lease-specific and every Rent Invoice
requires the applicable signed Lease.

An Invoice without a Lease must still have an approved billing source and
identifiable purpose within a supported Invoice category. Optional Lease
association does not authorize arbitrary charges or new Invoice categories.

---

## 20.4 Invoice Amount

An Invoice contains the financial obligation created at the time of billing.

The amount originally billed must remain historically identifiable even if:

- partial payments are later made
- credits are applied
- adjustments occur
- the Invoice is later voided
- a payment is reversed

The system must never rewrite historical billing in a way that makes the original financial event impossible to reconstruct.

---

# 21. Rent Billing

## 21.1 Monthly Rent

Rent is billed monthly in advance.

Recurring monthly rent invoices are generated automatically on the **25th of the current month** for the upcoming rental period.

The normal due date is the **5th**.

This recurring Due Date is established by the application/business rule and is not
replaced by an alternative recurring Due Date in the Lease.

Example:

```text
Invoice generation date: 25 July
Rental period: August
Due date: 5 August
```

The exact generation and due-date rules are defined in `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.

Amended by DL-075 (owner, 2026-10-20): the 25th issue day and the 5th Due Date day are the Settings defaults (days 1 to 28, the issue day after the reading day); a change starts with the next billing month and never changes an issued Invoice.

---

## 21.2 Initial Rent Invoice

The system proposes an Initial Rent Invoice Due Date of the Lease Start Date plus five
calendar days, including when that date falls in the following month (BR-RENT-009,
DL-064).

For a Lease Start Date on day 1 through day 20 inclusive, it covers the Lease Start Date
through the last calendar day of that month. For a Lease Start Date on day 21 or later, it
combines the prorated remainder of the start month plus the entire following calendar month
(BR-RENT-005, not the actual Move-in Date).
The prorated portion uses actual calendar days.

Example:

```text
Lease Start Date: 10 July

Initial Rent period:
10 July through 31 July

Due date: 15 July

Next regular rental period:
1 August through 31 August
```

For a 27 July Lease Start Date, the Initial Rent period is 27 July through 31 August and is
due 1 August. Normal billing then resumes on 25 August for 1–30 September, due
5 September. Initial and recurring Rent periods must never duplicate or overlap.

---

## 21.3 Final Partial Month

When the Lease ends partway through a calendar month and the applicable business rules require prorated rent, the final rental period is calculated using actual calendar days.

The exact termination and proration rules belong to `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.

---

## 21.4 Historical Rent Rates

A Lease may experience rent changes over time.

Historical rent rates must always be preserved.

A later rent change must not alter:

- previous rent invoices
- previous proration calculations
- historical reporting

The rent rate applicable to a billing period must be determinable from the historical Lease terms applicable during that period.

---

## 21.5 Contractual Late-payment Context

The Due Date on an applicable Invoice or Bill is the last calendar day on which
payment is timely. In Asia/Phnom_Penh, any remaining unpaid balance becomes overdue
on the next calendar day; there is no additional ten-day grace period.

The normal/default late-payment charge is 10% of the total remaining unpaid overdue
balance of that Invoice at assessment. It is calculated once for the Invoice as a
whole rather than independently by line. Authorized management makes one final
decision for that Invoice: confirm the default charge, apply a percentage below 10%
or otherwise approve a lower amount, or waive it. The decision never repeats or
compounds, and the late-payment charge itself never generates another late-payment
charge.

The source Invoice principal remains unchanged. The decision, balance snapshot,
default and actual percentages and amounts, actor, date/time, and reason remain
auditable. A positive approved amount creates a separate Late-payment Charge obligation
linked to exactly one Customer and exactly one source Invoice. It is payable immediately
at management confirmation without another Invoice or Invoice Due Date. It contributes
to the Customer's outstanding balance but is not an Invoice, Invoice Category,
Miscellaneous Charge, source-Invoice line, or source-principal modification. A waiver
creates no positive receivable but remains final and auditable.

For Rent nonpayment, a formal warning Notice is required at 20 calendar days overdue
when the applicable obligation remains unpaid. At 30 calendar days overdue, continued
nonpayment creates a Serious Nonpayment Default condition. Neither elapsed time nor
that condition automatically terminates the Lease, ends Occupancy, changes Unit
status, creates Move-out, or creates Final Settlement. Actual termination remains a
separate explicit authorized process subject to the signed Lease and any applicable
warning requirements.

Replaced by DL-064 (noted 2026-10-21, docs-only rules update 2b, part 9): the Rent nonpayment days are counted from the 1st of the billed month, not from the Due Date: day 20 is the 20th and day 30 is the 1st plus 29 days (BR-LEASE-026).

Full cure after the 20-day warning but before the 30-day threshold stops the current
30-day trigger while preserving overdue, Notice, Payment, and Allocation history. A
Payment after Serious Nonpayment Default does not erase that condition or automatically
decide an already initiated termination process.

When an Invoice contains both Rent and recurring-Service lines, valid Payment
Allocations and Customer Credit applications preserve which Invoice-line obligations
they satisfy. A valid Customer designation may control the target. Without a Customer
designation, the system proposes Rent first and then recurring-Service lines within
that selected Invoice; authorized staff must confirm the proposal before posting.
Remaining Rent after confirmed applications—not the mixed Invoice's total balance—
controls the Rent-specific warning and Serious Nonpayment Default tests.

Amended by DL-076 (owner, 2026-10-20): at 00:00 Property time on the first day after the Due Date, the app adds the late-payment charge by itself, at the Settings rate (DL-075, default 10%) of the amount unpaid at that moment, rounded half-up; no management decision is needed. One charge per Invoice; money paid later does not change it. The Owner or a Manager may reduce or waive it only after the Customer complains of a staff mistake, with one of three fixed reasons and a "What happened" text; the amount only goes down.

---

# 22. Utility Billing

Utility billing includes:

- Electricity
- Water

Utility charges are calculated from individual Utility Meter readings associated with each Unit.

---

## 22.1 Utility Consumption

Consumption is determined from sequential readings belonging to the same Utility Meter.

Conceptually:

```text
Consumption
=
Current Reading
-
Previous Reading
```

A reading from one Utility Meter must never be compared directly with a reading from a replacement meter unless an explicit meter-replacement process establishes the appropriate transition.

---

## 22.2 Meter Replacement

When a Utility Meter is replaced:

- the old meter remains in history
- its previous readings remain attached to it
- the replacement meter receives its own identity
- new readings are recorded against the replacement meter
- historical consumption must remain reconstructable

Meter replacement must never cause historical readings to be reassigned.

---

## 22.3 Utility Rates

Electricity and water rates may change over time.

Historical utility rates must therefore be preserved.

The applicable Utility Rate is the rate effective on the Utility Invoice
generation date. That selected rate applies to the entire consumption period
represented by the Invoice.

Consumption must not be split between old and new rates merely because a rate
changed during the represented consumption period.

Each utility bill must be explainable using:

- the relevant Utility Meter
- the relevant readings
- the consumption quantity
- the Invoice generation date
- the exact Utility Rate selected on that date
- the selected rate's effective-date information

Previously issued Utility Invoices must never be recalculated because of a later
rate change.

---

## 22.4 Confirmed Broken-Meter Estimation Basis

For the same Unit and Utility Type, use the three most recent complete historical
actual periods when three or more exist. When only one or two exist, use all of
those available complete historical actual periods; do not discard them. In either
case the weighted daily average is total actual consumption across the basis divided
by total calendar days represented, not an average of separately rounded period
averages. Estimated Consumption is that result multiplied by the applicable
unmeasured calendar days.

Only when zero complete historical actual periods exist does the estimate wait for
one complete future actual month or period for that same Unit and Utility Type.
Until then the estimate and affected charge remain pending and unfinalized with the
reason recorded. Another or comparable Unit and arbitrary consumption are never
substituted.

Move-out and Final Settlement use this same hierarchy. Only the zero-history case
waits for a future-period basis.

---

# 23. Configured Fixed Monthly Service Charges

The system supports fixed recurring Service types that the Property explicitly
approves and configures.

The currently approved and provided recurring Service is:

- Trash Collection

Internet and Monthly Cleaning are not currently provided and must not generate
charges. They may be configured in the future only after explicit Owner approval.
Staff must not invent an arbitrary Service through a generic or miscellaneous field.

Configured Service charges are not meter-based. Inactive or not-provided Services do
not generate charges.

They are billed according to the service rate applicable to the relevant billing period.
Service approval, configuration, activation/inactivation, effective periods, and
historical rates remain preserved.

Each approved, configured, active, and applicable recurring Service follows the same
Initial Invoice period structure as Rent. For a Lease Start Date on day 1 through day 20,
the initial Service period is the Lease Start Date through month-end. For a Lease Start
Date on day 21 or later, it combines the prorated remainder of that month and the full
following calendar month. The line uses its approved Service rate and proration rule, shares
the Initial Rent Invoice Due Date of the Lease Start Date plus five calendar days
(BR-SVC-012, BR-RENT-009), and must
not overlap later recurring Service periods. Normal generation then resumes on the
25th for the following uncovered calendar month.

```text
10 July Lease Start Date:
Initial recurring-Service period: 10–31 July
Initial Invoice Due Date:         15 July

27 July Lease Start Date:
Initial recurring-Service period: 27–31 July plus 1–31 August
Initial Invoice Due Date:         1 August
Next normal generation:           25 August for 1–30 September, due 5 September
```

Historical service rates must be preserved.

A current service-rate change must not alter prior invoices.

Amended by DL-075 (owner, 2026-10-20): Services are added in Settings by the Owner or a user with Settings access (DL-074), each with an English and a Khmer name, a Service type ("Only one per Lease" or "One or more per Lease") and a monthly rate that starts on the first day of a later month. Trash Collection is chosen by default on a new Lease. Issued Invoices keep their rate and name.

---

# 24. Damage Charges

Damage Charges represent amounts owed because of damage associated with a tenancy.

Damage Charges are separate from normal Rent, Utilities, and Service Charges.

They may arise during or after move-out inspection.

Damage Charges may participate in Final Settlement and may be satisfied using available deposits when permitted by the applicable business rules.

---

# 25. Miscellaneous Charges

Miscellaneous Charges represent authorized Lease-related charges that do not belong to another predefined Invoice category.

The existence of a Miscellaneous category must not be used to bypass proper domain classification when a specific charge type already exists.

Every Miscellaneous Charge must remain sufficiently described for future review and audit.

---

# 26. Payment Domain

## 26.1 Purpose

A Payment represents actual money received.

A Payment is distinct from an Invoice, Late-payment Charge, and Receipt.

```text
Invoice = money owed
Late-payment Charge = separate confirmed money owed
Payment = money received
Receipt = acknowledgment of that money received
```

A Payment does not automatically imply that a specific Invoice has been settled.

Payment allocation determines how received money is applied.

---

## 26.2 Payment Methods

The domain supports multiple payment methods.

`002_BUSINESS_RULES.md` establishes that accepted Payment Methods are configured
business data rather than a hard-coded list.

The selected payment method must remain part of the historical Payment record.

---

## 26.3 Payment Allocation

Payments are manually allocated by authorized staff.

A Payment may be:

- fully allocated
- partially allocated
- temporarily unallocated
- applied across multiple valid Customer obligations

An Invoice may receive:

- one Payment
- multiple Payments
- partial allocations from several Payments

Payment Allocation must preserve the target obligation. Within a mixed Rent and
recurring-Service Invoice, it preserves the amount applied to each relevant Invoice
line or obligation category. A separate Late-payment Charge can also receive an
Allocation without becoming an Invoice.

Conceptually:

```text
Payment $500
   │
   ├── $300 → Rent line on selected Invoice
   ├── $100 → Utility Invoice obligation
   ├──  $31 → separate Late-payment Charge
   └──  $69 → remains unallocated until an authorized disposition
```

Payment and allocation are intentionally separate business concepts.

---

## 26.4 Receipt

A Receipt is the numbered customer-facing acknowledgment for money recorded by a
Payment. It may show the Payment Date, Payment Method, received currency and amount,
USD accounting value, applicable KHR conversion facts, Deposit purpose, confirmed
Invoice-line or other obligation applications, and any Late-payment Charge amount paid.

Receipt content may be safely derived from immutable linked Payment, Allocation,
Deposit, and obligation records. Persistence details belong to
`004_DATABASE_MODEL.md`. Reprinting preserves the original Receipt identity and is an
auditable reprint event, not a second Payment or a second receipt of money.

---

# 27. Partial Payments

Partial payment is supported.

When a Payment allocation is less than the outstanding Invoice balance, the Invoice remains partially unpaid.

Example:

```text
Invoice amount:       $500
Allocated payment:    $200
Remaining balance:    $300
```

The original Invoice amount remains unchanged.

---

# 28. Overpayments

An Overpayment occurs when money received exceeds the amount currently allocated to outstanding obligations.

Overpayment must not cause an Invoice balance to become negative.

The excess remains part of the original RECEIVED Payment until the payer chooses
and authorizes an approved disposition. It becomes Customer Credit only after the
required authorization; it may instead be refunded or otherwise resolved under
an approved rule.

Example:

```text
Outstanding Invoice: $400
Payment received:     $500

Allocated:            $400
Unallocated excess:   $100
```

---

# 29. Advance Payments

An Advance Payment is money received before the related future Invoice or obligation exists.

Advance Payments remain part of the Customer's available financial balance until:

- allocated to a later Invoice
- refunded
- otherwise resolved through an authorized financial process

Advance Payments must not create artificial historical Invoices solely to absorb the money.

---

# 30. Customer Credit

Customer Credit represents money belonging to or available for a Customer that has not yet been consumed by a valid charge.

Customer Credit may arise only through a financial event explicitly authorized by
`002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`. This model does not independently authorize reversed
Allocations, Adjustments, or any open-ended event to create Customer Credit.

Customer Credit is distinct from a Deposit.

Customer Credit created from value released by a credit Adjustment belongs to the Customer named on the Lease and Invoice, even when a third party paid (DL-064, DL-068, BR-CREDIT-014).

```text
Customer Credit
    =
Money available for future allocation

Deposit
    =
Money held under a deposit obligation
```

These concepts must not be merged.

Customer Credit is a customer-related liability concept. It is not ordinary vendor
Accounts Payable, and this domain introduces no supplier or vendor AP process.

## 30.1 Customer Account Ledger

Each Customer has one unified Customer Account Ledger view that chronologically and
reconstructably combines the Customer's authoritative financial events and current
position. It can answer what was charged, paid, credited, refunded, adjusted, or held
as a Deposit; which Late-payment Charges exist; which obligations remain unpaid; the
Customer's total current amount due; and available Customer Credit.

The Ledger uses business-facing terms such as Amount charged, Payment received,
Credit, Refund, Outstanding balance, and Customer Credit. It does not require staff to
use formal debit/credit bookkeeping terminology and does not introduce General Ledger
accounting. Invoice, Payment, Allocation, Credit, Deposit, Refund, Adjustment,
Late-payment Charge, Final Settlement, and reversal records remain authoritative.

---

# 31. Reversals

A Reversal corrects or negates a previous financial event while preserving the original event in history.

Examples include:

- reversing an incorrect Payment
- reversing an incorrect Payment Allocation
- correcting an erroneous financial transaction

A reversal must never be implemented as silent deletion of the original financial record.

Conceptually:

```text
Original Financial Event
          │
          ▼
       Reversal
          │
          ▼
Correct Financial Position
```

Both the original event and the reversal remain auditable.

---

# 32. Refunds

A Refund represents money returned to a Customer.

Every Refund must be paid and recorded in USD (DL-060). A KHR-origin Payment
does not authorize a KHR Refund; its original KHR and conversion-rate evidence
remains preserved for audit without rewriting historical transactions.

Refunds may arise from:

- Customer Credit
- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit
- other authorized refundable balances

A Refund is itself a financial event and must remain permanently recorded.

The refund must identify the financial balance from which the refunded amount originated.

Refund methods are a configured list starting with Cash and Bank transfer, and every Refund records a reference note. A Deposit Refund goes to the Primary Tenant unless all Lease Signers agree in writing to another Signer (DL-069, BR-REFUND-014, BR-REFUND-015).

---

# 33. Deposit Domain

## 33.1 Deposit Types

The system recognizes exactly two deposit types:

- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit

No separate Reservation Deposit exists.

---

## 33.2 Security Deposit

Security Deposit is mandatory.

It begins during Reservation and continues into the resulting Lease.

The same Security Deposit obligation remains throughout the complete tenancy lifecycle.

---

## 33.3 Partial Security Deposit

The Security Deposit may be paid in installments.

A common Reservation scenario is:

```text
Monthly Rent:                       $500
Required Security Deposit:          $500

Initial Security Deposit payment:   $100
Remaining Security Deposit:         $400
```

The initial $100 is already a Security Deposit.

It is not renamed, converted, or reclassified when the Customer later moves in.

Twenty percent of monthly Rent is the normal suggested Reservation Security Deposit,
not a hard minimum. Authorized management may explicitly accept another amount; the
accepted required amount and override are audited, and a Reservation is not rejected
merely because collection is below 20%.

The remaining required Security Deposit is due within five calendar days after the Lease Start Date, together with the Initial Rent Invoice; an unpaid Security Deposit never blocks move-in (BR-DEP-006, DL-066).

---

## 33.4 Required and Held Amounts

The financial model distinguishes between:

```text
Required Deposit Amount
         │
         ├── Amount Received
         │
         └── Outstanding Amount
```

Example:

```text
Required:       $500
Received:       $100
Outstanding:    $400
```

Later:

```text
Required:       $500
Received:       $500
Outstanding:      $0
```

Deposit installments must remain individually traceable through the financial transaction history.

---

## 33.5 Security Deposit During Reservation

An active Reservation requires a Security Deposit according to the Reservation business rules.

The Reservation may therefore exist while the Security Deposit is only partially paid.

The suggested initial amount, authorized override, accepted required amount, and
Reservation-expiration consequences are defined in `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.

---

## 33.6 Security Deposit During Lease

When the Reservation's resulting Lease is signed (BR-RES-013, DL-064):

- the existing Security Deposit remains in place
- the Deposit is associated with the resulting Lease
- money previously received is not received again
- the remaining required amount is due within five calendar days after the Lease Start Date and never blocks move-in (BR-DEP-006, DL-066)

There is no financial “conversion transaction.”

---

## 33.7 Security Deposit Refundability

The Security Deposit is not refundable while the Lease remains active.

It is held until the Lease has ended and Final Settlement is performed.

A Security Deposit may then be:

- applied against authorized outstanding amounts
- partially refunded
- fully refunded
- fully consumed by settlement obligations

The exact refund and forfeiture conditions belong to `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.

A forfeited Security Deposit is forfeited in full and is never applied to what the Customer owes; at a normal Lease end it may pay remaining charges and the rest is refunded (DL-068, DL-069, BR-DEP-026).

---

# 34. Pet Deposit

A Pet Deposit applies only when a pet is approved and the applicable signed Lease
terms require that Deposit.

A Pet Deposit:

- is a liability
- is separate from the Security Deposit
- remains traceable independently
- primarily secures demonstrable pet-caused property damage or extraordinary/deep
  cleaning beyond normal turnover cleaning
- does not cap Customer liability for the full valid pet-caused repair or
  deep-cleaning cost
- may be refunded during an active Lease after the pet permanently leaves and all
  applicable pet-related obligations are resolved
- otherwise is resolved under authorized Final Settlement rules

If no pet is being kept, a Pet Deposit must not be required merely because the
Customer may keep a pet later.

If an approved pet is introduced later and the applicable signed Lease terms
require a Pet Deposit, that Deposit must be paid before or when the pet begins
staying in the Unit.

While the Lease remains active, a valid pet-caused damage or deep-cleaning charge is
paid directly by the Customer and does not automatically consume the Pet Deposit.
The Pet Deposit remains held unless the approved permanent-pet-departure Refund
process applies.

---

# 35. Deposits Versus Payments

Receiving money for a Deposit is still a receipt-of-money event, but the purpose of that money is different from normal revenue.

Conceptually:

```text
Money Received
      │
      ├── Payment toward Invoice
      │        └── Reduces receivable
      │
      └── Deposit Receipt
               └── Increases deposit liability
```

The financial model must preserve this distinction.

A Deposit receipt must never be treated as rent income merely because money was received.

---

# 36. Deposit Application

Deposits are not applied against ordinary monthly balances during an active Lease.

Deposit application to Invoice obligations occurs only during Final Settlement.
This does not prevent an explicit Refund of remaining Pet Deposit after the pet
permanently leaves during an active Lease and applicable pet obligations are
resolved.

Possible settlement uses include authorized:

- unpaid Rent
- unpaid Utilities
- unpaid Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges
- other valid settlement obligations

Deposit application must be explicitly recorded.

A Deposit balance must never silently decrease.

---

# 37. Final Settlement

## 37.1 Purpose

Final Settlement determines the complete financial position of a terminated Lease.

It reconciles all remaining obligations and liabilities before the tenancy is financially closed.

---

## 37.2 Settlement Inputs

Final Settlement may include:

- Outstanding Rent
- Final prorated Rent
- Final Electricity charges
- Final Water charges
- Outstanding Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges
- Outstanding Late-payment Charges
- Customer Credit
- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit
- Payments received during settlement

- Outstanding Late-payment Charges and the Unit cleaning charge at move-out are included; a Security Deposit forfeited under BR-DEP-026 is not available for application (DL-068, DL-069).

---

## 37.3 Settlement Calculation

Conceptually:

```text
Outstanding Charges
        ↓
Less Available Customer Credit
        ↓
Authorized Management Explicitly Selects/Confirms Deposit Applications
        ↓
Determine Remaining Customer Balance or Refundable Deposit Balance
        ↓
Refund Remaining Refundable Deposit
```

The final result may be:

```text
$0 Balance
```

or:

```text
Amount Due from Customer
```

or:

```text
Amount Refundable to Customer
```

---

## 37.4 Deposit Application During Settlement

Deposit application is explicit and traceable.

Pet Deposit remains identifiable first for valid pet-caused damage or deep-cleaning
obligations where applicable. Security Deposit may be selected for valid remaining
Settlement obligations. If valid obligations remain unpaid and the Customer has not
paid or will not pay them, authorized management may also select remaining Pet
Deposit for that valid Settlement balance. No additional FIFO ordering between
Deposit types is implied.

Example:

```text
Security Deposit Held:       $500

Outstanding Rent:            $150
Utility Charges:              $80
Damage Charges:              $70

Total Settlement Charges:    $300
Deposit Applied:              $300
Deposit Refundable:           $200
```

```text
Valid Damage Obligation:      $600
Security Deposit Held:        $500
Pet Deposit Held:             $200

Security Deposit Applied:     $500
Remaining Obligation:         $100
Pet Deposit Applied:          $100
Pet Deposit Refundable:       $100
```

The system must preserve:

- the original Deposit amount
- each Deposit receipt
- each amount applied
- the reason for each application
- the remaining amount
- any resulting Refund

---

# 38. Financial Balances

The domain distinguishes between several different balances.

## Invoice Balance

Amount still owed on a specific Invoice.

---

## Invoice-line or Obligation Balance

Amount still owed for a specific underlying line or obligation category within an
Invoice. These balances roll up exactly to the Invoice Balance.

---

## Late-payment Charge Balance

Amount still owed on a separate confirmed Late-payment Charge after valid Payment
Allocations, Customer Credit applications, reversals, or authorized corrections.

---

## Customer Outstanding Balance

Total current amount the Customer owes across Invoice balances and separate positive
Late-payment Charge balances. It does not merge or relabel the underlying obligations.

---

## Lease Outstanding Balance

Total remaining receivables associated with the Lease.

---

## Customer Credit Balance

Available Customer money not currently allocated to receivables.

---

## Deposit Balance

Amount currently held as a Deposit liability.

---

## Settlement Balance

The net financial position calculated during Final Settlement.

These balances must not be treated as interchangeable.

The Customer Account Ledger presents these balances together while preserving their
composition and authoritative source records.

---

# 39. Historical Financial Rates

Historical billing must be reproducible.

The system must preserve the exact rate selected under the applicable source and
effective-date rule when a charge was generated.

This includes:

- Rent rates
- Electricity rates
- Water rates
- explicitly configured recurring Service rates

A Utility Rate change affects Utility Invoices generated on or after its effective
date. Rent and fixed Service rates follow their applicable contractual period
rules.

Historical invoices must not change because a current rate changes.

---

# 40. Financial Auditability

Every financial change must be fully auditable.

This includes:

- Invoice creation
- Invoice modification
- Invoice voiding
- receipt of money as a Payment
- Receipt issuance and reprint
- Payment allocation
- Allocation change
- Payment reversal
- Customer Credit creation
- Customer Credit application
- Deposit receipt
- Deposit application
- Refund
- Final Settlement
- Rate changes
- Utility Reading modifications that affect billing
- Late-payment Charge proposals, reductions, waivers, and confirmed charges
- Late-payment Charge applications, remaining balances, satisfaction, and corrections
- Customer Account Ledger reconstruction and reconciliation
- Nonpayment Warning Notices and Serious Nonpayment Default conditions

The audit model must make it possible to determine:

```text
What changed?
Who changed it?
When was it changed?
What was the previous state?
What became the new state?
Why was the change made?
```

Technical audit storage and authorization rules are defined in later architecture documents.

---

# 41. Core Financial Invariants

The following financial invariants must always hold.

## Invoice Integrity

- An Invoice represents a real financial obligation.
- Historical Invoice amounts remain reconstructable.
- An Invoice cannot have a negative outstanding balance.

## Payment Integrity

- Payments cannot silently disappear.
- Payment Allocation is separate from recording the Payment.
- One Payment may be allocated across multiple valid Customer obligations.
- Partial allocation is supported.

## Credit Integrity

- Overpayment does not produce a negative Invoice balance.
- Excess money remains part of the RECEIVED Payment until an authorized Credit,
  Refund, or other approved disposition is recorded.
- Customer Credit and Deposit balances are different concepts.

## Deposit Integrity

- Security Deposit is mandatory.
- Security Deposit may be partially paid.
- The Deposit collected during Reservation remains the same Deposit during the Lease.
- Deposits are liabilities.
- Deposits cannot be used for ordinary monthly payment allocation while the Lease remains active.
- Deposit application occurs only during Final Settlement.
- A Property-caused Reservation cancellation may require a Security Deposit Refund
  before a Lease exists.
- For a Deposit associated with a Lease, Refund normally occurs only after the Lease
  has ended and settlement rules permit it. The approved exception is an explicit
  Refund of remaining Pet Deposit after the pet permanently leaves during an active
  Lease and applicable pet-related obligations are resolved.

## Rate Integrity

- Historical rates must remain preserved.
- Current rate changes never rewrite historical charges.

## Audit Integrity

- Financial corrections use explicit reversal, adjustment, void, allocation, application, or refund actions.
- Financial history must never be silently rewritten or deleted.

---

# 42. Domain Invariants

Domain Invariants are rules that must remain true regardless of which application workflow, user interface, API, or technical implementation performs the operation.

These invariants protect the integrity of the business model.

They are stricter than ordinary validation rules because violating them would place the system into an invalid business state.

---

# 43. Property Invariants

The following rules apply to the Property domain:

- One application manages exactly one Property.
- Every Unit belongs to the Property managed by the application.
- Operational records may not reference a Unit outside that Property.
- Historical records remain associated with the same Property for their entire lifetime.

---

# 44. Unit Invariants

A Unit is the central rentable asset in the system.

The following rules must always remain true:

- Every Unit has exactly one Unit Number.
- Every Unit has one Floor attribute.
- Every Unit has one Unit Type.
- Every Unit has one current operational Status.
- A Unit may have many historical Reservations.
- A Unit may have many historical Leases.
- A Unit may have no more than one active Reservation at a time.
- A Unit may have no more than one Signed Lease covering any point in time.
- A Unit may not be simultaneously available for conflicting tenancy commitments.

Unit status must reflect the actual operational condition of the Unit.

Unit statuses are:

- VACANT
- RESERVED
- OCCUPIED
- UNDER_MAINTENANCE
- CLEANING
- OUT_OF_SERVICE

Unit availability must not be inferred only from the status value when authoritative Reservation or Lease records indicate otherwise.

---

# 45. Reservation Invariants

A Reservation represents a temporary commitment to hold one Unit for one Customer.

The following rules apply:

- Every Reservation belongs to exactly one Unit.
- Every Reservation belongs to exactly one Customer.
- A Reservation may result in zero or one Lease.
- An ACTIVE Reservation holds the Unit.
- A CANCELLED Reservation no longer holds the Unit.
- A COMPLETED Reservation proceeded to its resulting Lease, which became SIGNED
  (BR-RES-013, DL-064); physical move-in is recorded separately.
- A COMPLETED Reservation cannot return to ACTIVE.
- A CANCELLED Reservation cannot return to ACTIVE.
- Reservation expiration changes must preserve historical extension records.
- Extending the expiration date does not create a new Reservation status.
- Security Deposit received during Reservation remains associated with the same tenancy process.

Reservation statuses are limited to:

```text
ACTIVE
CANCELLED
COMPLETED
```

---

# 46. Reservation Expiration Invariants

The Reservation has an original expiration commitment and a current effective expiration date.

When an authorized extension occurs:

- the original history must remain reconstructable
- the previous expiration date must remain known
- the new expiration date must be recorded
- the person authorizing the extension must be auditable
- the reason or memo associated with the extension must be preserved when required

The detailed maximum Reservation duration and extension conditions are defined in `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.

---

# 47. Lease Invariants

The Lease represents the contractual tenancy.

The following rules must always hold:

- Every Lease belongs to exactly one Unit.
- Every Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant.
- The Primary Tenant is a Customer.
- The Primary Tenant must be one of the Lease Signers.
- A Lease may have additional Lease Signers.
- Every Lease Signer is a Customer.
- Every Lease Signer is jointly responsible for the full Lease obligation.
- Responsibility is never divided into individual percentages or partial legal balances.
- A Lease may contain multiple Occupants.
- Occupancy and contractual responsibility remain separate concepts.
- Signed Leases for the same Unit must not have overlapping contractual periods.

Lease statuses are:

```text
DRAFTED
SIGNED
CANCELLED
TERMINATED
```

Allowed lifecycle transitions are:

```text
DRAFTED -> SIGNED
DRAFTED -> CANCELLED
SIGNED  -> TERMINATED
```

No other status transitions are valid.

---

# 48. Lease Signer Invariants

Lease Signers establish contractual financial responsibility.

The following rules apply:

- Every Lease has at least one Lease Signer before it becomes SIGNED.
- The Primary Tenant must be included among the Lease Signers.
- A Lease Signer may also be an Occupant.
- A Lease Signer is not required to be an Occupant.
- Removing a historical signer from a previously signed agreement must not erase the historical contract record.
- All signers are jointly responsible for the full unpaid Lease balance while their contractual responsibility applies.

---

# 49. Occupancy Invariants

Occupancy represents actual residence rather than contractual responsibility.

The following rules apply:

- Every Occupancy record belongs to one Lease.
- Every Occupancy record identifies one Customer.
- Occupancy records contain a Move-in Date.
- Occupancy records may contain a Move-out Date.
- An Occupancy record with no Move-out Date represents current occupancy.
- An Occupant does not become financially responsible merely because they live in the Unit.
- Historical Occupancy records must remain permanently available.

Occupancy must answer the business question:

> Who physically lived in this Unit, and during what period?

It must not be used as a substitute for Lease Signer responsibility.

---

# 50. Deposit Invariants

Deposits represent money held as liabilities.

The following rules apply:

- Every tenancy requires a Security Deposit.
- Security Deposit may be paid partially.
- Security Deposit may be received through multiple Payments.
- Money received during Reservation is already Security Deposit.
- The system must not create a separate Reservation Deposit concept.
- The same Security Deposit continues into the resulting Lease.
- The required amount and the amount actually received are separate business facts.
- The remaining Security Deposit balance is due within five calendar days after the Lease Start Date and may still be outstanding at move-in.
- An unpaid Security Deposit or Pet Deposit never blocks move-in (BR-DEP-006, BR-DEP-010, BR-LEASE-015, DL-066).
- Security Deposit is not refundable during an active Lease.
- Pet Deposit applies only when a pet is approved and the applicable signed Lease
  terms require that Deposit.
- If no pet is being kept, Pet Deposit is not required merely because a Customer
  may keep a pet later.
- If an approved pet is introduced later and the signed Lease terms require Pet
  Deposit, it must be paid before or when the pet begins staying in the Unit.
- Security Deposit and Pet Deposit remain separate liabilities.
- Deposits may only be applied as part of Final Settlement.
- Deposit application must never occur silently.
- Every application, refund, or financial correction must remain auditable.

---

# 51. Utility Meter Invariants

Utility Meters represent physical measurement devices.

Each Utility Meter records:

- Meter ID
- Serial Number
- Utility Type
- Description
- Status
- Installed Date
- Replaced Date
- Memo

The following rules apply:

- Every Utility Meter belongs to exactly one Unit.
- Every Utility Meter measures exactly one Utility Type.
- Supported Utility Types are Electricity and Water.
- A Unit may have multiple historical meters.
- A Unit may have no more than one active Electricity Meter.
- A Unit may have no more than one active Water Meter.
- A replacement meter receives its own identity.
- Historical Utility Readings remain attached to the meter that produced them.
- Replacing a meter never rewrites historical consumption.

---

# 52. Utility Reading Invariants

Each Utility Reading records:

- Reading ID
- Meter ID
- Reading Date
- Reading Value
- Modified Date

The following rules apply:

- Every Utility Reading belongs to exactly one Utility Meter.
- A Utility Reading cannot be transferred to another meter.
- Reading history must remain reconstructable.
- Changes to readings that influence financial billing must be audited.
- Meter replacement boundaries must be respected when calculating consumption.

The system does not currently require a separate Reading Type or Reading Source concept.

---

# 53. Invoice Invariants

Invoices represent financial receivables.

The following rules apply:

- Every Invoice belongs to exactly one Customer.
- An Invoice may additionally be associated with zero or one Lease.
- When a Lease association exists, the Invoice Customer, Unit, obligation,
  period, and Lease context must be consistent.
- Rent Invoices require the applicable signed Lease.
- Optional Lease association does not authorize arbitrary non-Lease charges or
  new Invoice categories.
- Every Invoice has an identifiable billing purpose.
- Every Invoice belongs to one supported Invoice category.
- The original billed amount must remain historically identifiable.
- Invoice outstanding balance cannot become negative.
- Payments do not directly rewrite Invoice amounts.
- Payment Allocations and Customer Credit applications reduce the identified
  Invoice-line or obligation balances and roll up to the Invoice outstanding balance.
- Voiding an Invoice preserves the original Invoice history.
- Historical Invoices remain reproducible using the applicable historical rates and billing data.

Supported Invoice categories are:

- Rent
- Utilities
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges

Deposits are not Invoice categories.

---

# 54. Payment Invariants

A Payment represents money actually received.

The following rules apply:

- Every Payment represents a real receipt-of-money event.
- Recording Payment and posting Payment Allocation are separate events.
- One Payment may be allocated to multiple valid Customer obligations.
- One Invoice may receive allocations from multiple Payments.
- Allocation to a mixed Invoice identifies sufficient line or obligation detail to
  determine remaining Rent and recurring-Service balances.
- Allocation to a Late-payment Charge reduces only that separate obligation.
- A Payment may remain partially or fully unallocated.
- Allocation is performed manually by authorized staff.
- Receipt is a separate customer-facing acknowledgment of Payment.
- Receipt reprint preserves the original Receipt identity and creates no new Payment.
- Payment history cannot be erased.
- Reversing a Payment must preserve both the original Payment and the reversal event.

---

# 55. Customer Credit Invariants

Customer Credit represents money available to the Customer that is not currently consumed by a receivable.

The following rules apply:

- Customer Credit is not a Deposit.
- Customer Credit may arise only through a source explicitly authorized by
  `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.
- An Invoice may not become negative in order to represent credit.
- Unallocated Payment value remains part of the Payment until an explicit
  `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md` disposition recognizes Credit or a Refund.
- Applying Customer Credit must be auditable.
- Applying Customer Credit must identify the target obligation and sufficient
  Invoice-line detail where needed to determine remaining Rent.
- Refunding Customer Credit must be auditable.

---

# 56. Historical Rate Invariants

The financial domain depends on historical rates.

The following rates may vary over time:

- Rent
- Electricity
- Water
- explicitly configured recurring Services

The following invariants apply:

- A rate change must never rewrite a previously issued historical charge.
- Historical billing must remain reproducible.
- The applicable rate must be determinable for any historical charge.
- Current rates and historical rates must be distinguishable.
- Historical invoices retain the economic meaning they had when created.

---

# 57. Final Settlement Invariants

Final Settlement closes the financial lifecycle of a Lease.

The following rules apply:

- Every terminated Lease must complete exactly one Final Settlement.
- Final Settlement belongs to exactly one terminated Lease.
- Final Settlement occurs only after the Lease is TERMINATED.
- All valid Settlement charges must be finalized before applications.
- Authorized Customer Credit must be applied before authorized management selects
  and confirms Deposit applications.
- Security Deposit and Pet Deposit remain identifiable separately.
- Deposit applications must identify the source Deposit, target obligation, amount,
  purpose, actor, time, reason, and authorization.
- Refunds must identify their financial source.
- Any remaining amount due from the Customer must remain identifiable.
- Final Settlement history must remain permanent.
- Closing settlement must not erase any underlying Invoice, Payment, Deposit, Credit, or Adjustment history.

- Final Settlement, deposit use, deposit forfeiture, Refunds, wrong-Invoice Payment moves and post-settlement corrections start as drafts and take effect only when a `financial.approve` holder confirms them; a finalized Settlement is never reopened, and an unpaid balance stays as debt on the Primary Tenant's Customer Ledger with no write-off (DL-068, DL-069, BR-AUTH-010, BR-SETTLE-016).

---

# 58. Audit Invariants

Auditability is a domain-wide requirement.

Every significant financial change must answer:

```text
What changed?
Who performed the change?
When did it occur?
What was the previous value or state?
What is the resulting value or state?
Why was the change made?
```

At minimum, full audit history is required for:

- Lease status changes
- Reservation changes
- Reservation expiration extensions
- Security Deposit changes
- Pet Deposit changes
- Utility Reading modifications
- Utility rate changes
- Service rate changes
- Rent changes
- Invoice changes
- Payment changes
- Payment Allocations
- Credits
- Reversals
- Refunds
- Final Settlement actions

Technical audit implementation is defined later in the architecture documentation.

---

# 59. Domain Events

Domain Events represent significant business facts that have occurred.

They are expressed in past tense because they describe completed business events.

Domain Events are not API messages, database triggers, or implementation mechanisms.

Their purpose is to define meaningful business transitions.

---

# 60. Property and Unit Events

Representative events include:

```text
PropertyCreated
UnitCreated
UnitStatusChanged
UnitReserved
UnitOccupied
UnitEnteredCleaning
UnitEnteredMaintenance
UnitMarkedOutOfService
UnitReturnedToVacant
```

These events describe significant changes to Unit availability or operational state.

---

# 61. Reservation Events

Representative Reservation events include:

```text
ReservationCreated
ReservationExpirationExtended
ReservationCancelled
ReservationCompleted
```

`ReservationExpirationExtended` records an extension while the Reservation remains ACTIVE.

`ReservationCompleted` represents completion of the Reservation lifecycle when its
resulting Lease becomes SIGNED (BR-RES-013, DL-064) and links the Reservation to its
exactly one resulting Lease; physical move-in is recorded separately.

---

# 62. Customer Events

Representative Customer events include:

```text
CustomerCreated
CustomerDetailsUpdated
```

Changes to identity or contact information must not destroy the historical relationships between the Customer and previous business records.

---

# 63. Lease Events

Representative Lease events include:

```text
LeaseDrafted
PrimaryTenantAssigned
LeaseSignerAdded
LeaseSignerRemovedBeforeSigning
LeaseSigned
LeaseCancelled
LeaseTerminationNoticeRecorded
NonpaymentWarningNoticeIssued
SeriousNonpaymentDefaultRecorded
RentNonpaymentCured
LeaseTerminated
```

A termination notice does not itself terminate the Lease.

The Lease remains SIGNED until the business process reaches actual termination.
Likewise, a Nonpayment Warning Notice or Serious Nonpayment Default does not itself
change Lease, Occupancy, Unit, Move-out, or Final Settlement state.

---

# 64. Occupancy Events

Representative Occupancy events include:

```text
OccupantAdded
OccupantMovedIn
OccupantMovedOut
```

These events preserve physical residence history independently from contractual responsibility.

---

# 65. Deposit Events

Representative Deposit events include:

```text
SecurityDepositRequired
SecurityDepositReceived
SecurityDepositFullyPaid
PetDepositRequired
PetDepositReceived
DepositAppliedToSettlement
DepositRefunded
```

A Security Deposit received during Reservation remains a Security Deposit throughout the tenancy.

No `ReservationDepositConverted` event exists because no such conversion occurs in the business domain.

---

# 66. Utility Events

Representative Utility Meter events include:

```text
UtilityMeterInstalled
UtilityMeterMarkedBroken
UtilityMeterReplaced
UtilityMeterRemoved
```

Representative Utility Reading events include:

```text
UtilityReadingRecorded
UtilityReadingCorrected
```

Corrections that affect billing require full audit history.

---

# 67. Billing Events

Representative Invoice events include:

```text
RentInvoiceGenerated
UtilityInvoiceGenerated
RecurringServiceLineAddedToInvoice
DamageChargeInvoiceCreated
MiscellaneousChargeInvoiceCreated
LatePaymentChargeDecisionRecorded
LatePaymentChargeConfirmed
LatePaymentChargeWaived
LatePaymentChargeSatisfied
LatePaymentChargeCorrected
InvoiceAdjusted
InvoiceVoided
```

The exact conditions for invoice creation and adjustment are defined in `002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`.

---

# 68. Payment Events

Representative Payment events include:

```text
PaymentReceived
ReceiptIssued
ReceiptReprinted
PaymentAllocated
PaymentAllocationReversed
PaymentReversed
AdvancePaymentReceived
CustomerCreditCreated
CustomerCreditApplied
CustomerCreditRefunded
RefundIssued
```

These events preserve the distinction between money received, money allocated, and money returned.

---

# 69. Settlement Events

Representative Final Settlement events include:

```text
FinalSettlementStarted
FinalChargesAdded
DepositApplied
CustomerCreditAppliedToSettlement
SettlementBalanceCalculated
SettlementRefundIssued
SettlementBalancePaid
FinalSettlementClosed
```

Closing Final Settlement marks financial completion of the tenancy but does not remove any historical source records.

---

# 70. Domain Event Principles

All Domain Events follow these principles:

- An event describes something that already happened.
- An event represents a meaningful business fact.
- Events must use domain terminology.
- Events must not expose technical implementation details.
- Events must not replace the authoritative business entities.
- Historical events must remain traceable when required for audit.

---

# 71. Bounded Contexts

The Property Rental Management System is one application but contains several distinct business areas.

These areas are modeled as Bounded Contexts to prevent concepts from becoming overloaded or tightly coupled.

The initial domain is divided into the following contexts:

1. Property and Unit Management
2. Customer Management
3. Reservation Management
4. Lease and Occupancy Management
5. Utility Management
6. Billing Management
7. Payment and Credit Management
8. Deposit Management
9. Move-out and Final Settlement
10. Audit and History

These boundaries describe business responsibilities rather than deployable services.

The application may remain a modular monolith while maintaining these logical domain boundaries.

---

# 72. Property and Unit Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns the physical rental inventory.

It manages:

- Property
- Unit
- Unit Number
- Floor
- Unit Type
- Unit operational status

It answers questions such as:

- What Units exist?
- Where is each Unit located?
- What type of Unit is it?
- Is the Unit operationally available?

It does not own:

- Customer identity
- Lease contracts
- Invoice balances
- Payment allocations

---

# 73. Customer Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns Customer identity and contact information.

It manages:

- Customer identity
- Customer personal details
- Contact information

It intentionally does not maintain permanent customer classifications such as:

- Tenant
- Former Tenant
- Occupant
- Reservation Customer

Those roles are derived from relationships in other contexts.

---

# 74. Reservation Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns the process of holding a Unit before move-in.

It manages:

- Reservation
- Reservation status
- Reservation expiration
- Reservation extension history
- Reservation Customer
- Reservation-to-Lease transition

It collaborates with:

- Property and Unit Management
- Customer Management
- Deposit Management
- Lease Management

---

# 75. Lease and Occupancy Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns contractual tenancy and physical occupancy.

It manages:

- Lease
- Lease status
- Primary Tenant
- Lease Signers
- Occupancy
- Lease dates
- Lease termination lifecycle

It answers separate questions:

```text
Who is contractually responsible?
```

and:

```text
Who physically lives in the Unit?
```

These concepts must remain distinct.

---

# 76. Utility Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns utility measurement history.

It manages:

- Utility Meter
- Meter installation
- Meter replacement
- Meter status
- Utility Reading

It provides authoritative consumption data to Billing Management.

It does not own utility invoices or payment status.

---

# 77. Billing Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns receivables.

It manages:

- Rent billing
- Utility billing
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges
- Invoice lifecycle
- Late-payment Charge decisions and separate obligations
- Historical billing rates

It consumes information from:

- Lease Management
- Utility Management
- historical rate information

It does not own money received.

---

# 78. Payment and Credit Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns Payments, Receipts, and allocation.

It manages:

- Payment
- Receipt
- Payment method
- Payment Allocation
- Advance Payment
- Overpayment
- Customer Credit
- Payment reversal
- Credit refund
- Customer Account Ledger projection

It collaborates closely with Billing Management but remains conceptually separate.

This distinction preserves the rule:

```text
Invoice = Amount owed
Late-payment Charge = Separate confirmed amount owed
Payment = Money received
Allocation = How received money is applied
Receipt = Customer acknowledgment of Payment
Customer Account Ledger = Reconstructable unified Customer view
```

---

# 79. Deposit Management Context

## Responsibility

This context owns deposit liabilities.

It manages:

- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit
- Required amount
- Amount received
- Outstanding amount
- Deposit application
- Deposit refund

It collaborates with:

- Reservation Management
- Lease Management
- Final Settlement

Deposits must remain separate from normal Customer Credit and Invoice payment balances.

---

# 80. Move-out and Final Settlement Context

## Responsibility

This context owns completion of the tenancy lifecycle.

It coordinates:

- termination notice
- move-out
- inspection
- final charges
- final utility billing
- outstanding balances
- Customer Credit
- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit
- deposit application
- refund
- remaining amount due
- final closure

It consumes information from several other contexts but owns the final settlement result.

---

# 81. Audit and History Context

## Responsibility

This context ensures that significant business and financial activity remains traceable.

It records sufficient history to reconstruct important changes across the system.

Audit concerns include:

- Actor
- Action
- Timestamp
- Previous state
- Resulting state
- Reason or memo
- Related business entity

Audit and History is a cross-cutting domain capability.

It must not become the authoritative source of current balances or operational state.

The authoritative state remains within the relevant business Aggregate.

---

# 83. Context Boundary Principles

The following principles govern communication between Bounded Contexts:

- Each business fact has one authoritative owner.
- One context may reference information owned by another context but must not silently redefine it.
- Financial responsibilities must remain separate from physical occupancy.
- Billing must remain separate from recording receipt of money as Payment.
- Deposits must remain separate from Customer Credit.
- Utility measurement must remain separate from Utility billing.
- Historical audit records must not replace authoritative domain state.
- Context boundaries must not be bypassed merely for implementation convenience.

---

# 84. Aggregate Coordination

Some operations require multiple Aggregates to participate in one business workflow.

Examples include:

## Reservation Creation

Coordinates:

```text
Customer
+
Unit
+
Reservation
+
Security Deposit
```

## Move-in

Coordinates:

```text
Reservation
+
Lease
+
Security Deposit
+
Occupancy
+
Unit
```

## Utility Billing

Coordinates:

```text
Customer
+
Unit
+
Applicable Lease (when the Invoice is Lease-associated)
+
Utility Meter
+
Utility Reading
+
Generation-date Utility Rate
+
Invoice
```

## Payment Processing

Coordinates:

```text
Customer
+
Payment
+
Receipt
+
Payment Allocation
+
Invoice
+
Late-payment Charge
+
Customer Credit
+
Customer Account Ledger projection
```

## Move-out

Coordinates:

```text
Lease
+
Occupancy
+
Unit
+
Utility Readings
+
Inspection
+
Final Charges
+
Final Settlement
+
Deposits
+
Customer Credit
+
Refund
```

These workflows do not imply that all involved concepts belong to one Aggregate.

Business coordination across Aggregate boundaries must preserve each Aggregate's invariants.

---

# 85. Domain Consistency Principles

The system distinguishes between business operations requiring immediate consistency and those that may be coordinated across multiple business steps.

Immediate domain consistency is required for rules such as:

- preventing a second active Reservation for the same Unit
- preventing overlapping Signed Lease coverage for the same Unit
- preventing invalid Lease status transitions
- preventing negative Invoice balances
- preventing allocation beyond available Payment value
- preventing Deposit application before Final Settlement
- preventing two active meters of the same Utility Type for one Unit

Longer workflows such as move-in and Final Settlement may coordinate several domain operations while preserving the integrity of every participating Aggregate.

Technical transaction boundaries are defined later in the Database Model and API Specification.

---

# 86. Domain Model Independence

The concepts in this document must remain independent from implementation technology.

Nothing in the domain requires a specific:

- programming language
- web framework
- database engine
- API protocol
- frontend framework
- cloud provider
- deployment architecture

The implementation must adapt to the domain model.

The domain model must not be distorted merely to simplify a particular technology choice.

---

# 87. Domain Model as the Foundation

This Domain Model establishes the vocabulary and conceptual structure used by all subsequent architecture documents.

The following documents must remain consistent with the concepts defined here:

```text
001_DOMAIN_MODEL.md
        │
        ▼
002_BUSINESS_RULES.md
        │
        ▼
003_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
        │
        ▼
004_DATABASE_MODEL.md
        │
        ▼
005_API_SPECIFICATION.md
        │
        ▼
006_UI_SPECIFICATION.md
        │
        ▼
007_TESTING_STRATEGY.md
        │
        ▼
008_SECURITY_MODEL.md
        │
        ▼
009_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md
        │
        ▼
010_DECISION_LOG.md
```

Later documents may add implementation detail, but they must not silently redefine the business concepts established in the Domain Model.

Any deliberate change to these concepts must be documented through the appropriate architectural decision process.

---

# 88. Domain Glossary

This glossary defines the official business terminology used throughout the Property Rental Management System.

All later documentation, code, APIs, database objects, user-interface labels, and tests should use these terms consistently unless a later architectural decision explicitly changes them.

---

## Property

The single apartment property managed by one deployed application.

The Property's authoritative business timezone is `Asia/Phnom_Penh`.

The current system does not support multiple properties in one application.

---

## Unit

A rentable residential space within the Property.

A Unit has:

- Unit Number
- Floor
- Unit Type
- Operational Status

Supported Unit Types:

- Studio
- One Bedroom
- Two Bedroom
- Three Bedroom

Supported Unit Statuses:

- VACANT
- RESERVED
- OCCUPIED
- UNDER_MAINTENANCE
- CLEANING
- OUT_OF_SERVICE

---

## Unit Number

The human-readable identifier used by the business to identify a Unit.

Examples:

```text id="8pjl2n"
101
302
A-05
```

The exact format is an implementation and business configuration concern.

---

## Floor

The floor on which the Unit is located.

Floor is an attribute of Unit and is not modeled as a separate domain entity.

---

## Unit Type

The classification of a Unit by residential layout.

Supported types are:

```text id="c173aw"
STUDIO
ONE_BEDROOM
TWO_BEDROOM
THREE_BEDROOM
```

Amended by DL-075 (owner, 2026-10-20): Unit Types are a Settings list; the four types above are today's values. A Unit Type used by a Unit cannot be removed.

---

## Unit Status

The current operational state of a Unit.

Unit Status describes availability or physical readiness, not Lease termination notice state.

A termination notice does not automatically change Unit Status.

---

## Customer

A person known by the Property Rental Management System.

Customer is role-neutral.

A Customer may participate in different business relationships over time, including:

- Reservation Customer
- Primary Tenant
- Lease Signer
- Occupant
- Former Occupant
- Payer

The system does not maintain permanent Customer Types.

---

## Reservation

A temporary business commitment that holds one Unit for one Customer until its Lease is signed (BR-RES-013, DL-064). A Reservation is optional (BR-RES-001, DL-066).

A Reservation has:

- one Customer
- one Unit
- an expiration date
- a status
- related Security Deposit activity

Reservation Statuses:

```text id="k31j8f"
ACTIVE
CANCELLED
COMPLETED
```

---

## Reservation Customer

The Customer for whom the Unit is reserved.

A Reservation contains exactly one Reservation Customer.

If the Reservation proceeds to a Lease, that Customer is expected to become the Primary Tenant.

---

## Reservation Expiration Date

The current date until which the Reservation remains valid.

The original expiration history must remain reconstructable if extensions occur.

---

## Reservation Extension Notice

A historical record of an approved change to the Reservation expiration date.

An extension does not create a new Reservation status.

---

## Security Deposit

A mandatory financial liability held in connection with a Reservation and resulting Lease.

A Security Deposit:

- may be paid partially
- may be paid in multiple installments
- begins during Reservation
- remains the same Deposit through the Lease
- is not rent income
- is not refundable while the Lease remains active
- is resolved during Final Settlement

There is no separate Reservation Deposit concept.

---

## Required Security Deposit

The total Security Deposit amount required by the tenancy agreement.

This is distinct from the amount already received.

---

## Security Deposit Received

The cumulative amount of Security Deposit money actually received.

---

## Security Deposit Outstanding

The remaining required Security Deposit amount not yet received.

Conceptually:

```text id="ivks21"
Outstanding Security Deposit
=
Required Security Deposit
-
Security Deposit Received
```

---

## Pet Deposit

A Deposit liability that applies only when a pet is approved and the applicable
signed Lease terms require that Deposit.

Pet Deposit is separate from Security Deposit.

---

## Lease

The contractual rental agreement for one Unit.

A Lease contains:

- exactly one Unit
- exactly one Primary Tenant
- one or more Lease Signers
- zero or more Occupants
- Lease terms
- associated financial obligations
- deposits

Lease Statuses:

```text id="f7y147"
DRAFTED
SIGNED
CANCELLED
TERMINATED
```

---

## Primary Tenant

The principal Customer associated with the Lease.

Every Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant.

The Primary Tenant must also be a Lease Signer.

A Customer may be the Primary Tenant on multiple Leases over time.

---

## Lease Signer

A Customer who has signed the Lease agreement and accepted contractual responsibility.

Every Lease Signer is jointly responsible for the full outstanding Lease balance.

Responsibility is not divided among Lease Signers.

A Lease Signer may or may not live in the Unit.

---

## Joint Responsibility

The rule that each Lease Signer is responsible for satisfying the full unpaid Lease obligation while that obligation remains outstanding.

Joint responsibility does not create duplicate debt.

---

## Occupant

A Customer who physically resides in the Unit.

Being an Occupant does not automatically make the Customer financially responsible.

---

## Occupancy

The historical record describing when a Customer lives in a Unit under a Lease.

Occupancy includes:

- Customer
- Lease
- Move-in Date
- Move-out Date

---

## Move-in Date

The date on which an Occupant begins residing in the Unit.

For the Primary Tenant, this generally corresponds to possession of the Unit.

---

## Move-out Date

The date on which an Occupant ceases residing in the Unit.

---

## Termination Notice

A formal record that a Lease is intended to end.

Termination Notice does not itself terminate the Lease.

A Lease remains SIGNED until the actual termination business action occurs.

---

## Nonpayment Warning Notice

The formal auditable warning required when an applicable Rent obligation remains
unpaid at 20 calendar days overdue. It is distinct from an ephemeral alert and does
not itself terminate the Lease.

Replaced by DL-064 (noted 2026-10-21, docs-only rules update 2b, part 9): the Rent nonpayment days are counted from the 1st of the billed month, not from the Due Date: day 20 is the 20th and day 30 is the 1st plus 29 days (BR-LEASE-026).

---

## Serious Nonpayment Default

The permanent condition recorded when an applicable Rent obligation remains unpaid
at 30 calendar days overdue. It permits authorized management to initiate the approved
termination or surrender process but performs none of the termination, Occupancy,
Unit, Move-out, or Final Settlement transitions itself.

Replaced by DL-064 (noted 2026-10-21, docs-only rules update 2b, part 9): the Rent nonpayment days are counted from the 1st of the billed month, not from the Due Date: day 20 is the 20th and day 30 is the 1st plus 29 days (BR-LEASE-026).

A later cure does not erase this condition or its history.

---

## Move-in

The business process through which an active Reservation becomes an occupied tenancy.

Move-in coordinates:

- Reservation
- Lease
- Security Deposit
- Occupancy
- Unit Status

---

## Move-out

The business process through which occupancy ends physically and the inputs for
later financial closure are collected. Financial closure occurs through Final
Settlement, which may remain pending after move-out.

Move-out may include:

- termination notice
- final occupancy date
- inspection
- final utility readings
- final charges
- Final Settlement
- Deposit application
- Refund
- archive

---

## Utility Meter

A physical meter assigned to one Unit.

Supported Utility Types:

```text id="mlmbvm"
ELECTRICITY
WATER
```

A Unit may have multiple historical meters but no more than one active meter for each Utility Type.

---

## Meter ID

The system identity of a Utility Meter.

---

## Serial Number

The physical serial number assigned to the Utility Meter.

---

## Utility Type

The type of utility measured by the meter.

Supported values:

- Electricity
- Water

---

## Installed Date

The date a Utility Meter became installed or active for the Unit.

---

## Replaced Date

The date a Utility Meter was replaced by another meter.

---

## Utility Reading

A recorded numeric reading from one Utility Meter on a specific date.

A Utility Reading contains:

- Reading ID
- Meter ID
- Reading Date
- Reading Value
- Modified Date

---

## Reading Date

The date on which the meter value was observed or recorded for business use.

---

## Reading Value

The cumulative meter value recorded at a point in time.

---

## Utility Consumption

The measurable amount of utility consumed between applicable readings.

Utility Consumption is derived from Utility Reading history and is not itself the authoritative raw measurement.

---

## Historical Rate

A rate selected for a historical charge under its applicable source and
effective-date rule.

Historical Rates must remain preserved so previous billing can always be reconstructed.

For a Utility Invoice, this is the Utility Rate effective on the Invoice
generation date and applied to the entire represented consumption period.

Examples include:

- Rent Rate
- Electricity Rate
- Water Rate
- explicitly configured Service Rate

---

## Invoice

A financial receivable belonging to exactly one Customer and optionally
associated with zero or one Lease.

When a Lease association exists, Customer, Unit, obligation, period, and Lease
context must be consistent. Rent Invoices require the applicable signed Lease.
Optional Lease association does not authorize arbitrary non-Lease charges or new
Invoice categories.

Supported Invoice Categories:

- Rent
- Utilities
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges

---

## Rent Invoice

An Invoice representing rental charges for a defined rental period.

Rent is normally billed monthly in advance. Every Rent Invoice requires the
applicable signed Lease.

---

## Utility Invoice

An Invoice representing Electricity and/or Water usage derived from Utility
Readings and the Utility Rate effective on the Invoice generation date. The
selected rate applies to the entire represented consumption period.

---

## Service Charge

A fixed recurring service-related charge.

The currently approved and provided recurring Service is:

- Trash Collection

Internet and Monthly Cleaning are examples of potential future Services, not current
charges. Any future Service requires explicit Owner approval and configuration before
billing. Free-form or generic “other recurring service” creation is not permitted.

An applicable configured recurring Service is a separate categorized line on the
Initial Rent Invoice for its Initial Service period and on later recurring Rent
Invoices for normal periods. Its initial coverage follows the Rent day-1-through-20/
day-21-or-later structure and must not overlap later recurring coverage.

---

## Damage Charge

A charge created for damage associated with the tenancy.

Damage Charges commonly arise during move-out inspection or settlement.

---

## Miscellaneous Charge

An authorized Lease-related charge that does not belong to another defined Invoice category.

Miscellaneous Charges must remain sufficiently described for audit purposes.

---

## Late-payment Charge Decision

The single final management decision for one applicable overdue source Invoice. It
preserves the Invoice-wide assessment base, 10% default, confirmed/reduced/waived
result, authorization, and audit history. A confirmed positive amount creates one
separate Late-payment Charge obligation; a waiver creates no receivable.

Replaced by DL-076 (owner, 2026-10-20): there is no management decision any more; the app adds the charge by itself the day after the Due Date. A reduction or waiver after a Customer complaint is recorded on its own.

---

## Late-payment Charge

A separate immediately payable Customer obligation created when authorized management
confirms a positive late-payment amount for exactly one source overdue Invoice. It is
not an Invoice, Invoice Category, Miscellaneous Charge, or source-Invoice modification.

---

## Payment

Money actually received.

Payment is distinct from Invoice, Late-payment Charge, and Receipt.

```text id="q8lv5y"
Invoice = Money owed
Late-payment Charge = Separate confirmed money owed
Payment = Money received
```

---

## Receipt

A numbered customer-facing acknowledgment of one Payment and its confirmed
applications. Reprint preserves the same Receipt identity and creates no new Payment.

---

## Payment Allocation

The explicit application of Payment value to one or more valid Customer obligations,
including sufficient Invoice-line or obligation detail for mixed Invoices and direct
application to a separate Late-payment Charge where applicable.

Allocation is performed manually by authorized staff.

---

## Partial Payment

A Payment or Payment Allocation that satisfies only part of an outstanding Invoice.

---

## Overpayment

A Payment amount greater than the obligations to which it is allocated.

Unused value remains part of the RECEIVED Payment until the payer authorizes an
approved Customer Credit, Refund, or other disposition.

---

## Advance Payment

Money received before the corresponding future receivable exists.

Advance Payment remains available until later allocated, refunded, or otherwise resolved.

---

## Customer Credit

Money available for use by a Customer that is not currently consumed by a valid
obligation and is not classified as a Deposit.

Customer Credit may arise only from financial events explicitly authorized by
`002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`; this definition creates no additional Credit source.

Customer Credit is not a Deposit, unallocated Payment, Invoice balance, Late-payment
Charge, or ordinary vendor Accounts Payable.

---

## Customer Account Ledger

The unified chronological and reconstructable financial view for one Customer. It
presents authoritative charges, Payments, Credits, Refunds, Adjustments, Deposits,
Late-payment Charges, applications, reversals, outstanding obligations, and current
balances without replacing or duplicating those source records.

---

## Reversal

A financial action that negates a previous financial event while preserving both the original event and the reversal in history.

---

## Refund

Money returned to a Customer.

A Refund must identify the balance from which the money originated.

Possible sources include:

- Customer Credit
- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit

---

## Final Settlement

The financial closing process for a terminated Lease.

Final Settlement reconciles:

- outstanding Invoices
- final Rent
- final Utilities
- Service Charges
- Damage Charges
- Miscellaneous Charges
- Customer Credit
- Security Deposit
- Pet Deposit
- Refunds
- remaining Customer balance

---

## Settlement Balance

The final net financial result after all settlement inputs are considered.

Possible results include:

- zero balance
- amount due from Customer
- amount refundable to Customer

---

## Deposit Application

The explicit use of held Deposit value against authorized obligations during Final Settlement.

Deposit Application must always remain auditable.

---

## Audit Record

Historical information describing a significant change in the system.

An Audit Record must be able to identify:

- what changed
- who changed it
- when it changed
- previous state
- resulting state
- reason or memo when applicable

---

# 89. Terminology Rules

The following terminology rules apply throughout the project.

## 89.1 Use Customer, Not Tenant, as the Person Entity

The canonical person entity is:

```text id="p21a31"
Customer
```

Do not create a permanent `Tenant` entity solely because a Customer currently has a Lease.

`Tenant` describes a role within a Lease relationship.

---

## 89.2 Use Primary Tenant for the Lease Role

Every Lease has one Primary Tenant.

This is a relationship between Customer and Lease, not a Customer Type.

---

## 89.3 Use Lease Signer for Contractual Responsibility

Financial responsibility is established through Lease Signer.

Do not use Occupant to determine Lease responsibility.

---

## 89.4 Use Occupancy for Residence History

The canonical concept for recording who lives in a Unit is:

```text id="jqq97g"
Occupancy
```

Do not infer occupancy exclusively from the Primary Tenant or Lease Signer records.

---

## 89.5 Do Not Use Reservation Deposit

The business term is:

```text id="ysx60g"
Security Deposit
```

Money collected during Reservation is already Security Deposit.

The following term must not be introduced:

```text id="6srd33"
Reservation Deposit
```

---

## 89.6 Do Not Use Converted for Reservation Completion

The approved Reservation completion status is:

```text id="1v67f2"
COMPLETED
```

Do not describe the Reservation as financially converted into a Lease or the Deposit as converted into another Deposit.

---

## 89.7 Extended Is Not a Reservation Status

Reservation extension is represented by a Reservation Extension Notice.

The Reservation remains ACTIVE while valid.

Approved Reservation statuses remain:

```text id="kwdy1p"
ACTIVE
CANCELLED
COMPLETED
```

---

## 89.8 Floor Is Not an Entity

Floor remains an attribute of Unit.

Do not create a Floor aggregate or entity unless a later documented requirement introduces floor-specific business behavior.

---

## 89.9 Commercial Unit Is Not a Supported Unit Type

The current domain does not contain Commercial Units.

Do not introduce commercial-specific concepts without a future approved domain change.

---

## 89.10 Utility Meter Is the Correct Term

Use:

```text id="sc8p8d"
Utility Meter
```

rather than:

```text id="99kzzu"
Utility Reading Meter
```

A Utility Meter exists independently from the readings recorded against it.

---

## 89.11 Reading Type and Reading Source Are Not Current Domain Concepts

The current Utility Reading model does not require Reading Type or Reading Source.

Do not add them without a future business requirement.

# 90. Domain Exclusions

The following concepts are intentionally excluded from the current Domain Model.

Their absence is deliberate and must not be interpreted as missing documentation.

---

## 90.1 Multi-Property Management

The application manages exactly one Property.

The following are excluded:

- Property switching
- Property portfolios
- Cross-property Customers
- Consolidated portfolio reporting

---

## 90.2 Commercial Leasing

The current application models residential Units only.

Commercial-specific concepts are excluded.

---

## 90.3 General Accounting

The application manages operational rental finances but is not a General Ledger.

Excluded concepts include:

- Chart of Accounts
- Journal Entries
- General vendor Accounts Payable
- Trial Balance
- Profit and Loss
- Balance Sheet
- Formal accrual accounting
- Revenue recognition accounting
- Bank reconciliation accounting

Customer Credit remains a customer-related liability concept and must not be renamed
or treated as ordinary vendor Accounts Payable.

Financial data may later integrate with a separate accounting system.

---

## 90.4 Payroll and Human Resources

Employee payroll, employment records, leave, and HR administration are outside scope.

---

## 90.5 Maintenance Work Order Management

The current domain may mark a Unit as:

- UNDER_MAINTENANCE
- OUT_OF_SERVICE

However, detailed maintenance management is outside scope.

Excluded concepts include:

- Work Orders
- Technician Scheduling
- Maintenance Inventory
- Repair Cost Tracking
- Vendor Dispatch

A dedicated maintenance domain may be introduced later.

Amended by DL-080 (owner, 2026-10-20): repair requests, routine Unit checks, visits, birthdays, "Paid on time" and the printed Joint Inspection and Unit Check forms are not in V1 (planned for V1.1). The move-out inspection records stay in V1.

---

## 90.6 Procurement and Inventory

Purchasing, stock control, furniture inventory, and consumable inventory are outside the current domain.

Amended by DL-078 (owner, 2026-10-20): each Unit has an inventory: a list of items with a quantity, grouped as Furniture, Appliances, Kitchen and Bathroom, each change dated and kept in History. It charges nothing by itself; move-out charges still come only from inspection findings. Purchasing, stock control and consumable inventory stay outside the domain.

---

## 90.7 Tax Accounting

Government tax calculation and tax filing are outside the current Domain Model.

---

## 90.8 Banking Integration

Automatic bank synchronization and payment-provider integration are outside the current domain definition.

The system records Payments but does not currently depend on external banking systems.

---

## 90.9 Automated Payment Allocation

Payment Allocation is intentionally manual.

Automatic allocation algorithms are not part of the current business model.

Replaced by DL-077 (owner, 2026-10-20): money pays Invoices in the same save step in which it is received. The app ticks Invoices oldest Due Date first, each late-payment charge right after its own Invoice; staff change the ticks only when the Customer names an Invoice, and pressing Receive payment is the staff confirmation. A third-party payer's money gets no automatic ticks.

---

## 90.10 Smart Meter Integration

Utility Readings are currently represented as business records independent of how they are physically collected.

Automatic smart-meter ingestion is outside the current scope.

---

# 91. Conceptual Domain Model

# 92. Core Tenancy Lifecycle

The complete tenancy lifecycle is conceptually:

```text id="e030zp"

# 93. Core Financial Model Summary

The financial model intentionally separates its authoritative obligations, money,
applications, acknowledgments, liabilities, and unified Customer view.

```text id="lf713m"
RECEIVABLES
    │
    ├── Invoice
    └── Separate Late-payment Charge

CASH RECEIVED
    │
    └── Payment

CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGMENT
    │
    └── Receipt

APPLICATION OF CASH
    │
    └── Payment Allocation

CUSTOMER MONEY AVAILABLE
    │
    └── Customer Credit

MONEY HELD AS LIABILITY
    │
    └── Deposit

UNIFIED CUSTOMER VIEW
    │
    └── Customer Account Ledger projection
```

These concepts must remain distinct throughout the system. The Customer Account Ledger
reconstructs and presents them but never replaces their authoritative source records.

Every Payment must always have a clearly identifiable business purpose and history.

---

# 94. Historical Integrity Model

Historical integrity is a first-class domain concern.

The following information must remain historically reconstructable:

- Customer relationships
- Reservations
- Reservation extensions
- Leases
- Lease Signers
- Occupancy periods
- Rent rates
- Utility rates
- Service rates
- Utility Meters
- Utility Readings
- Invoices
- Payments
- Receipts and reprint history
- Payment Allocations
- Late-payment Charge decisions, obligations, applications, and balances
- Credits
- Deposits
- Reversals
- Refunds
- Final Settlements

Current information must never overwrite historical business truth.

---

# 95. Derived Versus Authoritative Information

The system distinguishes authoritative facts from derived information.

## Authoritative Facts

Examples include:

- Lease Status
- Reservation Status
- Utility Reading
- Payment received
- Invoice issued
- Deposit received
- Occupancy Move-in Date
- Occupancy Move-out Date

These facts are explicitly recorded.

---

## Derived Information

Examples include:

- Current Customer Credit balance
- Invoice Outstanding Balance
- Invoice-line or obligation Outstanding Balance
- Late-payment Charge Outstanding Balance
- Customer Outstanding Balance
- Customer Account Ledger view
- Total Lease Outstanding Balance
- Current Security Deposit Outstanding
- Utility Consumption
- Unit availability
- Settlement net balance

Derived information must be calculated from authoritative records or maintained in a way that remains fully reconcilable with them.

Derived values must never become an independent competing source of truth.

---

# 96. Data Retention Principles

The domain assumes long-term retention of business history.

Records should not be physically deleted merely because they are no longer active.

Examples:

```text id="flqqzw"
Cancelled Reservation
        ≠ deleted Reservation

Terminated Lease
        ≠ deleted Lease

Replaced Utility Meter
        ≠ deleted Utility Meter

Voided Invoice
        ≠ deleted Invoice

Reversed Payment
        ≠ deleted Payment

Corrected Late-payment Charge
        ≠ deleted original Late-payment Charge

Reprinted Receipt
        ≠ new Payment or new Receipt identity

Moved-out Occupancy
        ≠ deleted Occupancy
```

Deletion policy and regulatory retention details are defined in later security and operational documentation.

---

# 97. Identity Principles

Every Entity and Aggregate Root has a stable identity.

Identity remains unchanged throughout the lifetime of the business record.

Examples include:

- Customer ID
- Unit ID
- Reservation ID
- Lease ID
- Deposit ID
- Meter ID
- Reading ID
- Invoice ID
- Payment ID
- Late-payment Charge ID
- Receipt Number or stable Receipt ID
- Settlement ID

Human-readable identifiers such as Unit Number or Meter Serial Number must not be assumed to replace stable system identity.

Database key implementation is deferred to `004_DATABASE_MODEL.md`.

---

# 98. Date and Time Principles

Business dates are significant throughout the domain.

Examples include:

- Reservation Date
- Reservation Expiration Date
- Lease Start Date
- Lease End Date
- Move-in Date
- Move-out Date
- Meter Installed Date
- Meter Replaced Date
- Reading Date
- Invoice Date
- Due Date
- Payment Date
- Refund Date
- Settlement Date

This Domain Model defines their business meaning.

Technical storage format, time zone handling, precision, and database representation are defined in later architecture documents.

---

# 99. Monetary Principles

All monetary values represent an amount together with a Currency.

USD is the main accounting currency and all financial transactions are recorded
in USD. Customers may pay in KHR only as a Payment-conversion option; original
KHR amounts and conversion evidence remain immutable audit facts. Refunds are
paid and recorded only in USD (DL-060).

Conceptually:

```text id="p7m4fb"
Money
├── Amount
└── Currency
```

The Domain Model does not assume floating-point arithmetic.

Technical monetary precision and database representation are defined in `004_DATABASE_MODEL.md`.

---

# 100. Domain Error Principles

An operation that violates a Domain Invariant must be rejected rather than silently corrected.

Examples include attempts to:

- create a second active Reservation for the same Unit
- create overlapping Signed Lease coverage for the same Unit
- terminate a Drafted Lease
- cancel a Signed Lease
- move in without satisfying required move-in conditions
- create two active Electricity Meters for one Unit
- allocate more Payment value than is available
- reduce an Invoice balance below zero
- apply a Deposit during an active Lease
- overwrite historical rates
- delete an audited financial event

The exact error representation belongs to the API and UI specifications.

---

# 101. Domain Decisions Established by This Document

The following architectural domain decisions are considered established by this document:

1. One application manages exactly one Property.
2. Floor is an attribute of Unit.
3. The system currently manages residential Units only.
4. Customer is the single canonical person entity.
5. Customer has no permanent Customer Type.
6. Reservation contains exactly one Customer.
7. A Reservation is optional; a walk-in Customer may sign a Lease without one (BR-RES-001, DL-066).
8. Reservation statuses are ACTIVE, CANCELLED, and COMPLETED.
9. Reservation extension is historical activity, not a Reservation status.
10. Security Deposit exists from the Reservation stage onward.
11. There is no separate Reservation Deposit.
12. Security Deposit may be partially paid.
13. Remaining required Security Deposit is due within five calendar days after the Lease
    Start Date and never blocks move-in (BR-DEP-006, DL-066).
14. Security Deposit is not refundable while the Lease remains active.
15. Security Deposit and Pet Deposit are liabilities.
16. Pet Deposit applies only when a pet is approved and the applicable signed
Lease terms require it.
17. Every Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant.
18. Primary Tenant must be a Lease Signer.
19. A Lease may have multiple Lease Signers.
20. Every Lease Signer is jointly responsible for the full balance.
21. Occupancy is separate from contractual responsibility.
22. Signed Leases for one Unit must not have overlapping contractual periods.
23. Rent is billed monthly in advance.
24. The Initial Rent Invoice follows the day-1-through-20/day-21-or-later coverage
    rules and its Due Date of the Lease Start Date plus five calendar days; prorated initial and final portions use
    actual calendar days when applicable.
25. Recurring monthly Rent Invoices are generated on the 25th and due on the 5th.
    Amended by DL-075: the 25th and the 5th are the Settings defaults.
26. Electricity and Water use individual Utility Meters.
27. One Unit may have only one active meter per Utility Type.
28. Historical Utility Meters and Utility Readings are preserved.
29. Trash Collection is the currently approved recurring Service; Internet and
    Monthly Cleaning are not currently provided, and any future Service requires
    explicit Owner approval and configuration.
    Amended by DL-075: Services are added in Settings (Owner or Settings access).
30. Historical rates must remain preserved; a Utility Invoice selects the Utility
Rate effective on its generation date and applies it to the entire represented
consumption period.
31. Payments and Payment Allocations are separate concepts.
32. Payment allocation is manual.
33. Partial payments are supported.
34. Overpayments and Advance Payments may create Customer Credit.
35. Customer Credit is separate from Deposit.
36. Reversals and Refunds preserve financial history.
37. Deposits may only be applied during Final Settlement.
38. Every Invoice belongs to exactly one Customer and may additionally be
associated with zero or one Lease.
39. Rent Invoices require the applicable signed Lease, and any Lease-associated
Invoice must remain consistent with its Lease context.
40. Every terminated Lease completes exactly one Final Settlement, which closes
its financial lifecycle.
41. Every significant financial change must be audited.
42. Historical records must not be silently deleted or rewritten.
43. An Invoice Due Date is the last timely calendar day; a remaining balance becomes
    overdue the next calendar day in Asia/Phnom_Penh.
44. Each applicable overdue Invoice receives at most one final late-payment decision
    based on its remaining unpaid overdue balance; the default is 10%, and authorized
    management may reduce or waive but never increase it above 10%.
    Amended by DL-076: the charge is added automatically; reduce or waive only after a complaint.
45. Late-payment charges do not repeat, compound, or rewrite source Invoice principal.
46. Rent nonpayment requires a formal warning Notice at 20 days overdue and records a
    Serious Nonpayment Default at 30 days overdue when still unpaid; neither event
    automatically terminates the Lease or ends Occupancy.
    Replaced by DL-064: the days count from the 1st of the billed month (BR-LEASE-026).
47. Applicable configured recurring Services follow the same Initial Invoice period
    structure and the same Due Date (the Lease Start Date plus five calendar days) as Initial Rent without overlap.
48. A positive confirmed Late-payment Charge is a separate immediately payable
    obligation linked to exactly one Customer and one source Invoice; it is not an
    Invoice, Invoice Category, Miscellaneous Charge, source-Invoice line, or principal
    modification.
    Amended by DL-076: payable at once when the app adds it, with no confirmation.
49. Payment Allocation preserves target-obligation and sufficient Invoice-line detail;
    within an undesignated selected mixed Rent Invoice, the confirmed proposal applies
    Rent first and then recurring-Service lines.
50. Existing FIFO proposal rules continue to order multiple applicable Invoices before
    the within-Invoice allocation proposal is applied.
51. Receipt is the numbered Customer acknowledgment of Payment and does not replace or
    duplicate the Payment.
52. Each Customer has a unified reconstructable Customer Account Ledger view whose
    underlying financial events remain authoritative.
53. Customer Credit is distinct from unallocated Payment, Deposit, Invoice balance,
    Late-payment Charge, and ordinary vendor Accounts Payable.
54. General Ledger accounting and general vendor Accounts Payable remain outside scope.

# 103. Change Governance

This document is the authoritative definition of the business domain.

Future implementation work must conform to it.

If a later requirement conflicts with this document, the conflict must not be silently resolved in code.

The process is:

```

This prevents the implementation and documentation from gradually diverging.

---

# 104. Document Dependency Rule

Later documents depend on this Domain Model.

Therefore:

> A lower-level document may refine a domain concept, but it must not contradict or redefine it without first updating the Domain Model and recording the decision.

For example:

- The Database Model may choose how to persist `LeaseSigner`.
- It may not redefine Lease Signer as an Occupant.
- The API Specification may expose Reservation commands.
- It may not introduce `EXTENDED` as a Reservation status.
- The UI may display Security Deposit payments made during Reservation.
- It may not label them as a separate Reservation Deposit.
- The Payment API may support allocation.
- It may not automatically allocate payments if manual allocation remains the approved business model.

---

# 105. Domain Model Completion Criteria

This Domain Model is considered complete for the initial architecture phase when it provides a stable answer to the following questions:

- What are the principal business concepts?
- Which concepts have independent identity?
- What relationships exist between them?
- Which states and lifecycles are valid?
- Who is contractually responsible?
- Who physically occupies a Unit?
- How does Reservation relate to Lease?
- How does Security Deposit behave before and during the Lease?
- How are Utility Meters and Utility Readings historically preserved?
- What constitutes an Invoice?
- What constitutes a Payment?
- What distinguishes a Receipt from Payment?
- What constitutes a separate Late-payment Charge obligation?
- How is mixed-Invoice value attributed to determine remaining Rent?
- How does the Customer Account Ledger provide a unified view without replacing source records?
- How is Customer Credit different from Deposit?
- How is a Lease financially closed?
- Which historical information must remain auditable?
- Which areas of the business own which concepts?
- Which implementation concerns are intentionally deferred?

Detailed operational formulas and authorization conditions are defined in
`002_BUSINESS_RULES.md`. There are currently no unresolved Owner decisions in these two
authoritative documents. Product and implementation concerns remain assigned to the
applicable later numbered specifications.

# 106. Final Domain Summary

The Property Rental Management System manages the full residential tenancy lifecycle for one Property.

At its center is the Unit.

A Unit may be reserved by one Customer and later leased under signed contractual
coverage; signed Leases for that Unit must not have overlapping contractual periods.

The Lease has exactly one Primary Tenant and may have multiple Lease Signers and Occupants.

Lease Signers establish contractual financial responsibility.

Occupancy establishes physical residence.

These concepts remain separate.

Security Deposit begins during Reservation and may initially be only partially paid. It remains the same Security Deposit throughout the tenancy and is held as a liability until Final Settlement.

Utility consumption is based on historically preserved Electricity and Water meters and their readings.

Billing creates receivables.

A positive confirmed Late-payment Charge creates a separate immediately payable
obligation without changing or reissuing its source Invoice.

Payments represent money received.

Receipts acknowledge those Payments without creating another receipt of money.

Payment Allocations determine how that money is applied, including sufficient
line/obligation detail to preserve remaining Rent and Service balances.

Overpayments and Advance Payments may create Customer Credit.

Deposits and Customer Credit are distinct financial concepts.

The Customer Account Ledger provides one reconstructable Customer financial view while
Invoices, Late-payment Charges, Payments, Allocations, Credits, Refunds, Adjustments,
Deposits, reversals, and Final Settlement remain authoritative.

Move-out ends physical occupancy, while Lease termination ends the contractual lifecycle.

Final Settlement closes the financial lifecycle by reconciling charges, Credits, Deposits, Refunds, and remaining balances.

Throughout the entire lifecycle, historical truth must remain preserved.

No significant financial event may be silently deleted, overwritten, or made impossible to reconstruct.

This Domain Model establishes the business foundation upon which all remaining system specifications are built.

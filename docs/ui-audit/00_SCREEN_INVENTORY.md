# 00 Screen inventory (UI v81, Part B1)

Date: 07/11/2026. Branch `ui-v81`. Source: `frontend/src/shell/navigation.ts` (menu, tabs, rights) and the page folders under `frontend/src/`.

How to read this list:

- **Address** is the hash route. A record page is `#/<page>/<detail>`.
- **Back** is where the "Back to X" link goes when the record was opened directly. When the person came from another page, Back returns to that page instead (shared helper `shell/backNav.tsx`).
- **Sub-tabs (v81)**: owner decision 07/11 07:55: record pages stay on one page with no sub-tabs. Sub-tabs are only for Settings and for pages that hold more than one table. A page with one table and no number cards gets no sub-tab row.
- **Batch** is the Part B batch that changes the screen.
